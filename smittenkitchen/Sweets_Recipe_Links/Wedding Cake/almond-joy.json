    "Grind the almonds in a food processor for about two minutes: it will first become crumbly, and the crumbs will get successively smaller until it is more of a fine powder. Keep it going through this stage, and when it nearly forms clumps, that\u2019s when you\u2019ve got it right. ",
    "Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and almond extract, then the corn syrup, processing until well-combined.",
    "Turn the mixture out onto a work surface and knead until it makes a smooth dough. If the dough seems too sticky, knead in a little more confectioners\u2019 sugar. If it seems too dry, add more corn syrup. At this point, the dough can be tightly wrapped in foil and refrigerated until needed. "
