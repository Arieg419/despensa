  "ingredient_list": [
    "2 cups (250 grams) plus 1 teaspoon all-purpose flour",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon table salt",
    "16 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 sticks, 8 ounces or 225 grams), softened",
    "3/4 cup (145 grams) packed light brown sugar",
    "1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar",
    "3 large eggs",
    "1 cup (235 ml) whole milk (though buttermilk, which was all I had on hand, worked just great)",
    "1/2 cup (about 85 grams) blueberries, fresh or frozen (if frozen, do not defrost first as it tends to muddle in the batter)",
    "Topping",
    "1/2 cup (about 85 grams) blueberries, fresh or frozen (do not defrost)",
    "1/4 cup (50 grams) granulated sugar",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "For the topping:",
    "Scatter blueberries over top of batter. Stir sugar and cinnamon together in small bowl and sprinkle over batter. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean, 45 to 50 minutes. Cool in pan 20 minutes, then turn out and place on serving platter (topping side up). Serve warm or at room temperature. (Cake can be stored in airtight container at room temperature up to 3 days.)"
