    "Make brownie batter: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Butter an 8-inch square baking pan. Heat butter and chocolate in a 3-quart heavy saucepan \u2014 though I did mine double-boiler style, placing the mixing bowl I was using over simmering water, thereby creating one less dirty dish and melting the chocolate more gently \u2014 over moderately low heat, whisking occasionally, just until melted. Remove from heat and whisk in sugar, eggs, vanilla, and a pinch of salt until well combined. Whisk in flour until just combined and spread in baking pan.",
    "Make cheesecake batter: Whisk together cheesecake batter ingredients in a small bowl until smooth. Dollop over brownie batter, then swirl in with a knife or spatula.",
    "[I actually like using a butter knife because the tip of it is round enough that you can use it to fold bits of the brownie batter over the cheesecake batter for a more visibly marbled effect. Try it!]",
    "Sprinkle chocolate chips over cheesecake/brownie batter swirl. Although it might be more logical to just mix them into the cheesecake batter (and feel free to do this, it will have no ill-effect) I thought it might interrupt the swirl-ability of it.",
    "Bake brownies:  Bake until edges are slightly puffed and center is just set, about 35 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature.",
    "Slicing tip: I like to chill my brownies until they\u2019re almost frozen before cutting them. It makes it much easier to get a clean slice. I also like to eat my brownies super-cold, but that\u2019s just personal taste."
