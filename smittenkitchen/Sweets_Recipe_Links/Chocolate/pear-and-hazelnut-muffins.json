    "Heat oven to 425\u00b0F. Butter a standard 12-cup muffin tin or line it with papers.*",
    "Peel (if you so desire, can be skipped) pears, then halve and core them. Grate pears on the large holes of a boxed grater into a large bowl. You should have about 1 cup grated (although I ended up with 1 1/2, opting to meet the recipe halfway and used 1 1/4 cups). Stir in melted butter, sugar, buttermilk, eggs and vanilla until combined.",
    "In a separate bowl, stir together the oats, flours, baking soda, baking powder, spices, salt, all but 1/2 cup coarsely chopped hazelnuts, and chocolate chunks, if you\u2019re feeling extra indulgent. Gently fold this dry ingredient mixture into the wet batter until just combined; do not overmix.",
    "Fill muffin cups almost up to the top and sprinkle with the reserved 1/2 cup hazelnuts. Place muffins in oven and immediately reduce the heat to 375\u00b0F. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of muffins comes out batter-free.  ",
    "Cool muffins in pans for 10 minutes, then transfer to a cooling rack. Muffins will keep for 2 days at room temperature in an airtight container.",
    "* Unsolicited plug: Just bought these for the first time, which were wonderful at keeping the muffins from sticking to the paper."
