    "Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread the peanuts evenly over a cookie sheet and roast until they darken, about 10 minutes, rattling them around a bit halfway through to they toast evenly. (If you, like me, were unable to find raw peanuts, just toast them for a 5 minutes to deepen their flavor.)  ",
    "Transfer the peanuts to a food processor and grind them for about 5 minutes. First they\u2019ll become a paste and will cause any toddler in your midst to have a meltdown from the ruckus. Then they\u2019ll become more of a paste and finally, they\u2019ll liquefy. Scrape down the sides as needed.",
    "Add the cocoa, sugar, salt and two tablespoons of the oil to the food processor and continue to process until well blended, about 1 minute. Add more salt if needed. Add the last tablespoon of oil if the consistency seems too thick.",
    "Store in refrigerator up to a week in a covered container. When it is full chilled, like peanut butter, it will become thick and swipe with a teaspoon will leave a telltale impression. Look, I\u2019m just warning you, okay?"
