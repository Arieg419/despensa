    "Preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (165\u00b0C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.\nSift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended.\nBeat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended.\nStir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time (for giant cookies) or a tablespoon at a time (for smaller cookies) onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart.\nBake larger cookies for 15 to 17 minutes, or 10 to 12 minutes for smaller ones (check your cookies before they\u2019re done; depending on your scoop size, your baking time will vary) in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely."
