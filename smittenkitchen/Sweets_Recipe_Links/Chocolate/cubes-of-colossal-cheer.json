    "Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Butter a 9-x-13-inch baking pan. If not nonstick coated, cover the bottom with a rectangle of parchment paper. Set pan aside.",
    "In a large bowl, cream butter and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Beat in egg yolks and vanilla. Sift flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt together into a separate bowl. Alternately mix in sour cream and then dry ingredients into butter mixture until both are used up and the batter is smooth and very thick. In a medium bowl, beat eggs whites until stiff, then fold into batter.",
    "In a small dish, whisk together sugar and cinnamon for filling and topping.",
    "Spread half the cake batter in the bottom of prepared pan. Sprinkle with half of cinnamon-sugar mixture and 1 cup of chocolate chips. Dollop remaining cake batter over filling in spoonfuls. Use a rubber or offset spatula to gently spread it over the filling and smooth the top. Sprinkle batter with remaining cinnamon-sugar and remaining chocolate chips. With the palm of your hand, ever-so-gently press the chocolate chips a bit into the batter. No need to submerge them, you just want to make sure they adhere bit.",
    "Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, rotating halfway through, until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.",
    "Updated 5/2/11: I made some small updates to this recipe\u2019s instructions, adding a few details and weights and the missing salt measurement. I also swapped the first photo in the post with one that more accurately reflects the cakes final appearance (billowy, bronzed and strewn with button-like chocolate chips, sigh)."
