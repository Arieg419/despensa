    "Whisk egg whites and sugar together in a big metal bowl over a pot of simmering water. Whisk occasionally until you can\u2019t feel the sugar granules when you rub the mixture between your fingers.",
    "Transfer mixture into the mixer and whip until it turns white and about doubles in size. (Here\u2019s a tip: when you transfer to the mixer, make sure you wipe the condensation off the bottom of the bowl so that no water gets into the egg whites. This can keep them from whipping up properly.)",
    "Add the vanilla.",
    "Finally, add the butter a stick at a time and whip, whip, whip.",
    "Deb note: Do not have a panic attack when this takes a while to come together (though I did every time). One super-large batch took 15 minutes, but it did and will come together. Patience, young Jedis."
