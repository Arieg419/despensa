    "Reinhart\u2019s commentary: You can attractively garnish this bread by embossing a sprig of fresh rosemary in the top of the loaf.  Mist the dough just after the final shaping with water and lay the spring flat so that it adheres fully.  Don\u2019t leave any of the needles hanging in the air, as they will burn during the baking stage without the protection of the dough."
