    "In addition: Either an electric coffee/spice grinder or exceptional skill crushing spices in a mortar and pestle",
    "Grind fennel seeds in grinder until ground but not powdery. Transfer to a small bowl or cup, then stir in oil until combined. Let stand 15 minutes.",
    "Whisk together lemon juice, shallot, salt, and sugar in another small bowl or cup until salt and sugar are dissolved. Stir fennel oil, then add to shallot mixture in a slow stream, whisking until combined.",
    "Toss lettuces and celery in a large bowl with just enough vinaigrette to coat. Season with black pepper to taste.",
    "Pairing: I think this salad would be fantastic with maybe some shards of your favorite hard cheese and a poached egg on top, should those of you out there not be at a point in your lives when runny yolks are verboten. (Sniffle.)"
