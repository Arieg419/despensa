    "Preheat oven to 250\u00b0F and preheat waffle iron. Sift together flour, brown sugar, baking powder and soda, salt, and spices. Whisk egg yolks in a large bowl with buttermilk, pumpkin, and butter until smooth. Whisk in dry ingredients just until combined. ",
    "In a mixing bowl with a whisk attachment, whisk the egg whites until they hold soft peaks (as in, far softer than the over-beaten whites you\u2019ll see in my picture above). Folk them gently into the waffle batter, until just combined.",
    "Brush waffle iron lightly with oil and spoon batter (about 2 cups for four 4-inch Belgian waffles) into waffle iron, spreading quickly. Cook according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. ",
    "Transfer waffles to rack in oven to keep warm and crisp. Make more waffles in same manner. "
