    "Accompaniment: Sliced bananas; plain yogurt flavored with vanilla extract, pumpkin or apple butter",
    "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Stir together all ingredients except the fruit in a large bowl until combined. Spread mixture evenly on a large (17-by 12-inch) shallow baking pan lined with parchment paper and bake, stirring occasionally, until golden brown, 30 to 35 minutes, but checking every five minutes after the 15-minute mark because it burns quickly. Transfer granola, in pan, to rack to cool stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. ",
    "Stir in dried fruit.",
    "Granola keeps, frozen (the fruit\u2019s moisture softens granola if not kept frozen) in an airtight container, a few months."
