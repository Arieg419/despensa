    "Make the sumac-pickled onions: Combine red onion, wine vinegar, sumac and 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt in a small dish and set aside while you prepare the other ingredients, or ideally at least 15 minutes.\nCombine all salad ingredients, including red onions and their pickling liquid, in a medium bowl and season to taste with salt and red pepper. Taste and adjust ingredients as desired \u2014 I\u2019ve seen versions of the recipe with more honey, olive oil and lemon; I didn\u2019t need them but you might find you do.\nThis salad can be prepped ahead, but I\u2019d keep the dressing off of it until at most an hour before serving so it doesn\u2019t discolor the sprouts."
