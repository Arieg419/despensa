    "In the bottom of a cocktail shaker, lightly muddle mint \u2014 no need to render it into small flecks, but if you break it up a little, more flavor will be released. Add pineapple, lime, honey, coconut milk and a few ice cubes and shake it well. Pour over ice cubes in glasses, finish with a splash of seltzer and garnishes. Close your eyes and pretend you\u2019re somewhere tropical."
