    "Make dough: Whisk the flour, salt, sugar and zest together in the bottom of a large bowl. Work the butter into the flour with your fingertips or a pastry blender until mixture resembles a coarse meal and the largest bits of butter are the size of tiny peas. Stir ricotta and 3 tablespoons water together in a small dish and pour into butter-flour mixture. Stir together with a flexible spatula as best as you can, then use your hands to knead the mixture into a rough, craggy ball. Wrap in plastic and flatten into a disc. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour or up to 48 hours, or you can quick-firm this in the freezer for 15 minutes.",
    "Assemble galette: Heat oven to 400 degrees. On a floured counter, roll the dough out into a large round-ish shape, about 14 to 15 inches across. ",
    "[If you\u2019d like to form yours into a star, as shown, use the red dashed outline of this template [PDF]. It will print smaller on an 8.5\u00d711-inch piece of paper than you need, but you can use it as a rough guide to cut as large of a pentagon shape as your dough will allow.] ",
    "Transfer round or pentagon-shaped dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet; I like to fold my dough gently, without creasing, in quarters then unfold it onto the baking pan. [If you\u2019re making a star, cut a 1-inch notch in the center of each side, angling it toward the center, as shown in the blue dashed lines of the template.] ",
    "Stir together all of the filling ingredients and spread them in the center of the dough, leaving a 2-inch border. If you\u2019re making a round galette, fold the border over the filling, pleating the edge to make it fit. [If you\u2019re making a star shape, fold each of the 5 corners into the center, along the green dotted lines of the template. Pinch the outer corners closed, to seal in the filling and the shape.] ",
    "Whisk egg yolk and water together and brush over exposed crust. Sprinkle with coarse sugar.",
    "Bake galette: For 30 minutes, or golden all over. Remove from the oven and let stand for 5 minutes, then slide the galette onto a serving plate. Cut into wedges and serve hot, warm or at room temperature, preferably with vanilla ice cream. [My favorite vanilla ice cream recipe is used here.]"
