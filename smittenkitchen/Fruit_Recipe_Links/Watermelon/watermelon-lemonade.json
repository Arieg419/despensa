    "Stir it all together and serve over ice. Garnish it with a thin watermelon or lemon wedge, if you\u2019re feeling fancy.",
    "Spritzy variation: I have never met a beverage I didn\u2019t think would taste better bubbly, thus, if you\u2019re looking for a spritzier version of this, swap one-third (1/4 cup) or more of the water with seltzer or sparkling water.",
    "Boozy variation: My husband thinks this would taste even better with a splash of vodka. I am not one to argue.",
    "* Make your own simple syrup: Please. I see it sold in stores and it just boggles my mind. Simmer one part water with one part sugar (I did a cup of each and ended up with more than I needed for a quadruple batch) until sugar has dissolved. Let cool. Or, you can use my speedier method where you simmer one part sugar with half as much water and once it has dissolved, add the second half of the water, cold, which cools the mixture down faster (when you like nothing to slow your pace to the nearest mocktail)."
