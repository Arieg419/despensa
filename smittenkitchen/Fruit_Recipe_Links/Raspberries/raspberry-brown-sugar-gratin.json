    "Preheat broiler. Gently fold raspberries and sour cream together in a shallow 1-quart dish. Press the brown sugar through a sieve or mesh colander so that it sprinkles evenly over the dish. (I tried using a sifter; don\u2019t bother, it doesn\u2019t work.) Run the dish under the broiler until the sugar just starts to caramelize. Eat at once.",
    "Keeping: The leftovers might look like something died in your fridge but I can assure you, are equally delicious. "
