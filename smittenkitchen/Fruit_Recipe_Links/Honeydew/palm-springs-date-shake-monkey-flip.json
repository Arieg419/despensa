    "If you\u2019d like the smoothest date shake: Pour boiling water over dates in a medium bowl, cover with a lid and let steep for 10 to 15 minutes (longer if you have time). Blend both water and dates in blender until smooth \u2014 it will seem like too much water at first but will eventually become a thickish puree. Transfer to freezer for a few minutes to cool it, if it\u2019s not cold enough already. Add date puree back to blender bowl, if they\u2019re not there already.",
    "If you don\u2019t mind some nubby bits of dates in your shake: Blend dates with a splash or two of the milk until they\u2019re finely ground.",
    "Both methods: Add nutmeg, milk and ice cream and blend until smooth. Pour into glasses, top with whipped cream and a cherry. ",
    "To Make A Monkey Flip",
    "Use all the ingredients above, plus 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/4 cup chocolate syrup and 2 medium bananas and blend until smooth. You\u2019ll end up with 5 small (8-ounce) shakes instead of 4, but that last one can be your little secret."
