    "In a small bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, cornstarch and powdered sugar. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese and butter until fluffy. Add the sugar-cornstarch mixture and vanilla, beat until frosting is smooth and light. Chill the bowl in the refrigerator until it thickens back up a bit, about 30 minutes, then spread or dollop on cooled cupcakes.",
    "Tip: Did you know you can make your own brown sugar?",
    "Some notes, or questions I am going to anticipate and try to answer before they are asked: I bought the brown cupcake liners at the New York Cake & Baking Supply on 22nd Street (and wow, do I miss only living a few blocks from there) but they\u2019re also available on Amazon and from many other online baking supply shops. I piped dollops of the frosting with a Wilton #10 round tip. I have a small, inexpensive kit like this (but a different version) that pretty much works for anything I need to do. It\u2019s a great investment for those of us that just like to dabble in decorating at home."
