    "Place carrots in a heatproof bowl. Bring remaining ingredients to a boil in saucepan, then reduce heat and simmer 2 minutes. Pour pickling liquid over carrots and cool, uncovered. Chill carrots, covered, at least 1 day for flavors to develop.",
    "Carrots keep, chilled in an airtight container, 1 month.",
    "* From my own experience, and from comments I have received, I\u2019ve learned that dill seeds aren\u2019t always the easiest thing to find. Mine are from McCormick, but they were also the only bottle I could find in the two different stores I went to. If you can\u2019t find them, use fresh or dried dill instead. You can put the dried dill in with the brine as you boil it. If fresh dill, I would drop it in the container your are storing the carrots in, just before you put them in the fridge."
