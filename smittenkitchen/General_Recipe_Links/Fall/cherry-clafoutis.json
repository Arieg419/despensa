    "Heat oven to 400F. Beat the sugar and eggs together with a whisk until they lighter in color. Gradually add butter, beating to incorporate. Add the flour and salt all at once and whisk until the batter is a homogeneous mixture. Next slowly pour in the milk a little at a time. Add the extract, and brandy or rum if you are using it, mixing well. The batter should be very smooth and shiny.\nPlace the cherries in a buttered glass or earthenware baking dish, cake pan (9 or 10 inches in diameter) or skillet that can go in the oven. (I use a 9-inch cake pan.) Pour the batter over the fruit. Bake 25 to 30 minutes, until slightly browned and almost completely set in the middle. Let sit at least 15 minutes before serving in wedges. I like it dusted with powdered sugar.",
