    "In a medium-size heavy saucepan, combine condensed milk, coconut milk, butter and corn syrup. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and whisk constantly until fudgy. The recipe notes that when mixture is ready, it will pull together into one soft piece, leaving browned residue on bottom of pan and that this should take 8 to 10 minutes. This took me 20 to 25 minutes, and the candy began taking on a beige, caramelized color.",
    "Slide mixture into a bowl. (Don\u2019t scrape the pan; leave any residue behind.) Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until very firm, at least 4 hours. Or, you could realize that the nanny has to leave in an hour, chill it for only 30 and discover that nothing bad will happen if you don\u2019t wait the whole cooling time. You\u2019ll have to be more careful if you use \u201creal\u201d i.e. meltable chocolate sprinkles but otherwise it will have no ill-effect to speed the process up.) ",
    "Scoop out teaspoonfuls of the mixture (I used my one teaspoon measure) and use your hands to roll into balls, about 3/4-inch in diameter. I found having just a drop or two of water in my palms \u2014 not wet, just a little moist \u2014 helped form them. Set aside on a baking sheet.",
    "Place toppings in wide bowls and roll brigadeiros through them, covering the surface completely.  Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 1 month. Serve at room temperature.",
    "Chocolate \u201cvermicelli\u201d: I got a little freaked out when I saw the ingredient list on the chocolate sprinkles I had brought home from the store. Look, I don\u2019t need to pretend that chocolate sprinkles are health food, but I like to imagine I\u2019m eating something with at least a minute smidgen of chocolate in it. I ended up spending way too much on a bottle of \u201cchocolate vermicelli\u201d (they look like chocolate sprinkles but are almost 100% pure chocolate, and delightfully, taste that way too) but I\u2019d buy them next time from Amazon or King Arthur Flour\u2019s Baker\u2019s Catalog for much less.",
    "Pistachios: Since toasted nuts always, always taste better than raw ones, I toasted and ground a batch to coat the candy only to find the brown/green shade\u2026 um, a little unpretty. Looks won out and I used ground raw pistachios in the end. I actually ended up preferring the softness of the coating.",
    "Those tiny cups: I know someone is going to ask me where I bought those colorful little candy cups and I\u2019m sorry, as my answer could not be more inconvenient: Vienna. A grocery store. I\u2019m kind of obsessed with going to grocery stores in foreign countries and always walk out with random stuff like this. Anyway, Amazon sells #4 size cups (1-inch base) in brown and white; however, mine are actually #3 size (3/4 to 7/8-inch base) which I found online at a smaller store."
