  "ingredient_list": [
    "1 pound of small pasta (I used shells because I imagined the peas would nest in there and gah, such cuteness)",
    "1/4 pound snow pea pods, ends trimmed",
    "1/2 pound fresh summer peas, which yielded about 1 cup once shelled",
    "3/4 to 1 cup Roasted Red Pepper Vinaigrette (recipe below)",
    "1 red bell pepper, roasted, skinned and seeded or the equivalent from a jar, drained",
    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons red wine vinegar (and up to 2 tablespoons more if you, like us, like that extra bite in your dressing)",
    "1 tablespoon chopped shallot (about 1 small)",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "Several grinds of black pepper"
