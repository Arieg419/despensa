    "In a nonreactive saucepan, heat the vinegar with the salt and sugar until they are dissolved. Remove from the heat, and add the cold water. (This gives you a leg up on getting the liquid to cooling the liquid.)",
    "When the vinegar mixture is cool, pack the sugar snaps, garlic and chile peppers or flakes into a 1-quart jar or bowl, and pour the brine over it. Cover with a non-reactive cap, or, er, plastic wrap.",
    "The original recipe suggests you store the jar in the refrigerator for two weeks before eating the pickled peas, but good luck with that. They\u2019re quite delicious and already lightly pickled by 24 hours later."
