    "Heat oven to 360\u00b0F (180\u00b0C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.",
    "In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars together with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add egg and vanilla, beating until incorporated, and scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in salt fine sea or table salt and baking soda until combined, then the flour on a low speed until just mixed. The dough will look crumbly at this point. With a spatula, fold/stir in the chocolate chunks. ",
    "Scoop cookies into 1 1/2 tablespoon (I used a #40 scoop) mounds, spacing them apart on the prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle each with a few flakes of sea salt. Bake for 11 to 12 minutes, until golden on the outside but still very gooey and soft inside. Out of the oven, let rest on baking sheet out of the for 5 minutes before transferring a cooling rack.",
    "Extra dough \u2014 I know, what\u2019s that?! \u2014 can be formed into scoops and frozen on a sheet until solid, then transferred to a freezer bag. I\u2019ve baked these right from the freezer; they need, at most, 1 minute more baking time. You could also form them into a 2-inch log, freeze it, and slice and bake the cookies off as desired. The only difference I\u2019ve noted between the cookies baked right away and those baked a day or more later is that the older cookie dough is less puffy when baked. "
