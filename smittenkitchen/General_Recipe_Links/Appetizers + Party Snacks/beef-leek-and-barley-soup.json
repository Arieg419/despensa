    "1. Trim two big, meaty short ribs and put them on the bottom of your soup pot.",
    "2. Add 1/2 cup of barley, three big cloves of garlic shopped up, two chopped onions, and three leeks cut lengthwise and then into segments\u2013use both the white and the green parts. You can also add mushrooms and any other vegetables you might like. Grind in a little black pepper.",
    "3. Add about eight cups of filtered water or beef stock and let it simmer on the back burner for at least three hours while you go about your business. You can also add lima beans, cube potatoes, peas, corn, string beans and chopped tomatoes at any point, or the second day, should you have any leftover.",
    "4. Before serving, skim off the fat\u2013there will be a bit, as short ribs are quite fatty\u2013take the meat off the bones, chop it and put it back in the soup."
