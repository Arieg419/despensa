    "Rinse and dry the grapes, and pull them carefully from their stems. Using a small sharp knife, trim away the \u201cbelly button\u201d at the stem end of the grape (and try not to eat all of the belly buttons at once, m\u2019kay?), exposing a bit of the flesh inside. Divide the grapes among 2 pint-sized clean, dry canning jars.",
    "In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat and then you have two choices. The original recipe has you pour the bring mixture over the grapes and let them cool together. I personally prefer a cold brine on certain foods, not wanting to wilt the fresh fruit, so I cool the brine completely before pouring it over. The former will yield a more tender pickle, and it will pick up the brine\u2019s flavor faster. The latter will take a bit longer to souse, but the grapes will stay more firm. Both will be delicious.",
    "Once cool, chill the grape and brine mixture in their jars in the refrigerator for at least eight hours or overnight. Serve cold, perhaps at a cheese course, and I say you should let people figure out for themselves what they\u2019re eating."
