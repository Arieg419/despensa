    "Make pearl sugar: David Lebovitz \u2014 a man with such an impassioned following that the day he linked to a recent recipe on this site, two different parents came up to me at kindergarten drop-off to ask if I really knew him \u2014 gave me a great tip this week:  crush sugar cubes into coarse bits to create makeshift pearl sugar. And here\u2019s an even more DIY approach. I haven\u2019t tested these out (see above: circa 2008 impulse buy) but I have a feeling they\u2019ll get you close to what we\u2019re going for here."
