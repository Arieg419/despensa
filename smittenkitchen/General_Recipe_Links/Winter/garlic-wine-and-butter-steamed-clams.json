    "If you think your clams may not be clean, wash them first: Fill a large bowl with cool tap water and place the clams in it. Let them soak for 20 minutes during which they\u2019ll expel any sand and grit.",
    "While they\u2019re soaking, grill or broil your bread: Dab both sides lightly with olive oil, if using, and grill or broil until well-toasted on both sides.",
    "Lightly scrub your clams. Discard any with chipped shells.",
    "In a large saute pan with a lid, melt butter and add garlic, shallots, salt and pepper flakes. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes over medium-high. Add wine \u2014 and as soon as it simmers, add all the clams and cover with a lid. In three minutes, almost all should be wide open; discard any that do not open. Transfer to a bowl and ladle cooking liquid over. Scatter with herbs and serve with grilled bread and lemon."
