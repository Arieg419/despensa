    "Fry eggs: Heat a wok or small skillet over the highest heat. Once hot, add enough oil to reach a depth of a generous 1/4-inch. Once the oil is hot enough to smoke, carefully crack the eggs into the oil \u2014 cautiously, as they will splatter a lot \u2014 and decrease the heat to medium-high. The eggs will hiss, sputter and the whites should puff and develop translucent bubbles. Once they\u2019re very crispy and a deep golden brown underneath, 45 seconds to 1 minute, use a thin spatula to flip the eggs, trying not to break the yolks but not fretting if it happens. Cook for another minute on the second side, until the yolks are set but still slightly molten (aim to have them a little less loose than mine, shown above). Transfer eggs to paper towels; you can cook them up to 15 minutes before serving. Discard oil and wipe out wok or skillet.",
    "Assemble salad: Place all salad ingredients in a large bowl. Quarter the eggs through the yolks and add them to the salad.",
    "Make the dressing: Place the lime juice, palm syrup or dark brown sugar and water, fish sauce, garlic and chiles in the same wok or skillet. Set it over medium heat and heat the mixture until it just begins to sizzle at the edges, less than 30 seconds. ",
    "Finish and serve: Pour the hot dressing over the salad and eggs. Stir gently to combine. If you\u2019re feeling fancy, transfer the salad, liquid at all, to a plate in a low heap. Eat at once."
