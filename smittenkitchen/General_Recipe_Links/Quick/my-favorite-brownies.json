    "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F. Line an 8\u00d78-inch square baking pan with parchment, extending it up two sides, or foil. Butter the parchment or foil or spray it with a nonstick cooking spray. ",
    "In a medium heatproof bowl over gently simmering water, melt chocolate and butter together until only a couple unmelted bits remain. Off the heat, stir until smooth and fully melted. You can also do this in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring between each. Whisk in sugar, then eggs, one at a time, then vanilla and salt. Stir in flour with a spoon or flexible spatula and scrape batter into prepared pan, spread until even. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out batter-free. ",
    "Let cool and cut into desired size. If you\u2019re like me, you will prefer these and all brownies, cold or even frozen. But I bet you\u2019re normal and will just eat them hot from the pan. If desired, dust the brownies with powdered sugar before serving."
