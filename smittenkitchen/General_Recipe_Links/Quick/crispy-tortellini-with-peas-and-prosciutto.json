    "Heat a large, deep skillet with a lid** over medium-high heat. If using, add prosciutto in a single layer and cook until curling and browned underneath, about 2 minutes. Flip over and let cook until browned on the other side. Transfer a paper towel to blot oil and cool.\nAdd oil to same skillet and heat it for a minute. Add frozen tortellini in a single layer and cook for 2 to 4 minutes, until they\u2019re browned underneath. Sprinkle with frozen peas and add water to pan. Be careful; it\u2019s going to ROARHISS wildly. Put the lid on, and let them steam for about 5 minutes but don\u2019t go too far because if the water cooks off too quickly, you\u2019ll want to add a splash more. At 5 minutes, all water should have cooked off. Scoops pasta and peas into bowl. If you find any pasta has stuck, just add a splash more water over high heat to \u201cdeglaze\u201d them off \u2014 loosen them with a thin spatula and toss them around until they\u2019re crisp again.\nImmediately dollop on cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche so it melts over the pasta. Squeeze lemon juice over, then sprinkle with salt, pepper, crumble prosciutto over (if using), then slivers of mint and parmesan, if desired. Dig in. Give your freezer a pat on its back.I use this one."
