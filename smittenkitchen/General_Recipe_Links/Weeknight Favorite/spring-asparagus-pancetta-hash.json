    "Heat a 12-inch cast iron frying pan over medium heat. Fry the pancetta, turning it frequently so that it browns and crisps on all sides; this takes about 10 minutes. Remove it with a slotted spoon and drain it on paper towels. Leave the heat on and the renderings in the pan. (With a well-seasoned cast iron, this should be all the fat you need to cook the remainder of the hash. If you\u2019re not using a cast iron, you might need to add a tablespoon or so of oil; if you\u2019ve skipped the pork, you\u2019ll want to start with 2 tablespoons oil.)",
    "Add the potatoes don\u2019t move them for a couple minutes. Use this time to season them well with salt and pepper. Once they\u2019ve gotten a little brown underneath, begin flipping and turning them, then letting them cook again for a few minutes. The idea is not to fight them off the frying pan, once they\u2019ve gotten a little color, it\u2019s easier to flip them and you\u2019ve gotten closer to your goal of getting them evenly browned. ",
    "When the potatoes are about three-fourths as crisped and brown as you\u2019d like them \u2014 this takes about 15 minutes \u2014 add the onion. (I add this now, not earlier, because I find it often burns before the potatoes are done.) Cook for an additional 5 minutes. Add the asparagus, cover the pan and cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until crisply cooked. (Skinny asparagus will take just 5 minutes; thicker asparagus will take longer.) Remove the lid, return the pancetta to the pan for another minute, to reheat. Taste for seasoning and adjust if needed. Serve immediately. "
