    "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Either cut the butter pieces into the flour mixture with a pastry blender or rub them in with your fingertips until well-combined. Stir in the cheddar, jalape\u00f1os and sour cream until the mixture forms a sticky dough. Pat it out to a 1/2-inch thickness on a very well-floured counter and use a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to cut six rounds. Bake on an ungreased (or parchment-lined, if your baking sheets are as \u201cweathered\u201d as mine are) for 15 to 17 minutes, until golden on top.",
    "Do ahead: If you\u2019d like to serve them over a couple days, I recommend freezing already formed but unbaked biscuits until you are ready to bake them \u2014 you can bake them directly from the freezer, adding just a minute or two to the baking time."
