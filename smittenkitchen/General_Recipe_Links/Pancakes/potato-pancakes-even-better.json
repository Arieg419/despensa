    "In a food processor or on a box grater, coarsely shred the potato and onion. For longer strands, lay the potato sideways in the chute of your food processor. Transfer to a colander or wrap in a cheesecloth sling, and squeeze as dry as possible. Let stand for 2 minutes, then squeeze dry again.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, egg, salt and pepper together. Stir in the potato onion mixture until all pieces are evenly coated.",
    "In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil until shimmering. Drop packed tablespoons of the potato mixture into the skillet and flatten them with the back of a spoon. Cook the latkes over moderately high heat until the edges are golden, about 1 1/2 minutes; flip and cook until golden on the bottom, about 1 minute. Drain on paper towels. Repeat with the remaining potato mixture, adding more oil to the skillet as needed.",
    "Do ahead: Latkes are a do-ahead-er\u2019s dream. You can also keep latkes warm in the oven for an hour or more, if you\u2019re waiting for stragglers to arrive. Cooked, they keep well in the fridge for a day or two, or in the freezer, well wrapped, for up to two weeks. Reheat them in a single layer on a cookie sheet in a 400 degree oven until they\u2019re crisp again. Bonus: If you undercooked them a bit or didn\u2019t get the browning on them you\u2019d hoped for, you can compensate for this in the oven. "
