    "Heat oil and butter in a large, heavy wide pot over moderate heat. Cook onion with salt, stirring until it begins to caramelize, about 8 minutes. Add remaining vegetables and stock and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook, partially covered, until vegetables are very tender, about 20 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes off heat before pureeing to desired consistency. Season with additional salt and pepper to taste."
