    "Make the dressing: Whiz the carrots, shallot and ginger in a blender or food processor until finely chopped. Scrape down the sides, then add the miso, vinegar and sesame oil. While the machine running, slowly drizzle in the grape seed oil and the water.\nAssemble salad: Trim and chop lettuce into small wedges. Arrange on a platter. Scatter onion and avocado on top.* If you\u2019d like, and I do, sprinkle some flaky sea salt and black pepper over the salad at this point. Dollop with plenty of dressing and serve with remaining dressing on the side.I also added a few strips of purple and yellow carrot on top that had been cut with a juleinne peeler, plus some snipped chives. Toasted black and white sesame seeds would also make a pretty garnish here."
