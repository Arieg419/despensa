    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread nuts (if using pretzels, don\u2019t add them yet) on a tray and toast for 10 to 15 minutes, until lightly golden and fragrant. While they\u2019re toasting, whisk butter, rosemary, cayenne, sugar and salt in the bottom of a large bowl. When nuts are toasted, add them to bowl and stir to evenly coat. Add pretzels, if using, and coat again. Spread back on tray and toast for another 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly, then serve warm in bowls. Nuts are also good at room temperature, and keep for weeks in airtight jars."
