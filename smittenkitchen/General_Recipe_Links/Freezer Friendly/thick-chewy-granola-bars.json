    "Preheat the oven to 350&#176F. Line an 8\u2033 x 8\u2033 x 2\u2033 pan in one direction with parchment paper, allowing it to go up the opposing sides. Lightly grease the parchment paper and the exposed pan, or coat with a non-stick spray. ",
    "Stir together all the dry ingredients, including the fruit and nuts. In a separate bowl, whisk together the vanilla, melted butter or oil, liquid sweeteners and water. Toss the wet ingredients with the dry (and peanut butter, if you\u2019re using it) until the mixture is evenly crumbly. Spread in the prepared pan, pressing them in firmly to ensure they are molded to the shape of the pan. (A piece of plastic wrap can help with this, as you press down on the back of it.)",
    "Bake the bars for 30 to 40 minutes, until they\u2019re brown around the edges \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid to get a little color on the tops too. They\u2019ll still seem soft and almost underbaked when you press into the center of the pan but do not worry, they\u2019ll set completely once completely cool.",
    "Cool the bars in their pan completely on a cooling rack. (Alternately, after about 20 minutes you can use your parchment \u201csling\u201d to lift and remove the bars, and place them in their paper on the rack to cool the rest of the way. This can speed the process up.)",
    "Once cool, a serrated knife (or bench knife) to cut the bars into squares. [Updating to note, as many had crumbling issues:] If bars seem crumbly, chill the pan of them further in the fridge for 30 minutes which will fully set the \u201cglue\u201d, then cut them cold. To store, wrap the bars individually in plastic or stack them in an airtight container. In humid weather, it\u2019s best to store bars in the refrigerator. They also freeze well.",
    "*Suggestions: Dried cranberries, apricots, pecans, sunflower seeds, coconut, walnuts, sesame seeds, pepitas, dried pples or even chocolate chips. My mix: 1/2 cup wheat germ, 1 cup dried cherries, 1 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup pecans and 1/2 cup dried unsweetened coconut flakes. Because my pieces were all pretty coarse, I pulsed them in the food processor a few times to break it up a little, though this isn\u2019t necessary if you don\u2019t mind yours chunkier."
