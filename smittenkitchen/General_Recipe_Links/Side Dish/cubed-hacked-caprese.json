    "Mix and season and then reseason again to adjust to your taste. Eat at once or keep it in the fridge up to a few days (really, it will depend on how fresh your mozzarella is; the made-daily stuff is only good for a day or two, most others will last nearly a week)."

  "ingredient_list": [
    "3/4 to 1 pound fresh mozzarella, diced into 1/2-inch cubes",
    "1 pound peak-season tomatoes (I prefer roma for this because they\u2019re less wet, but other varieties also work), diced into 1/2-inch cubes",
    "1 15-ounce can white beans, drained and rinsed or 1 3/4 cups white beans that you\u2019ve cooked fresh",
    "1/4 cup pesto (or a handful of slivered basil plus 1/4 cup olive oil)",
