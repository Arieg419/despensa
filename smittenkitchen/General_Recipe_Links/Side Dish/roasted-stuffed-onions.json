    "Make onion shells: Cut a 1/2-inch-thick slice from tops of onions, discarding tops, and trim just enough from bottoms for onions to stand upright. Scoop out all but outer 2 or 3 layers from each using a small ice cream scoop or spoon (don\u2019t worry if you make a hole in the bottom), reserving scooped-out onion and onion shells separately. ",
    "Make stuffing: Coarsely chop enough scooped-out onion to measure 3 cups. ",
    "Cook bacon in 2 batches in a 12-inch heavy skillet over moderate heat, stirring, until crisp, about 10 minutes, then transfer with a slotted spoon to paper towels to drain, reserving about 1/3 cup fat in skillet. ",
    "Add chopped onion, celery, salt, and pepper to skillet and saut\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 over moderately high heat, stirring, until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saut\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9, stirring, 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in spinach, bread, cashews, butter, 1 cup stock, and bacon, then cool completely. ",
    "Roast onions: Preheat oven to 425\u00c2\u00b0F. Arrange onion shells, open sides up, in a 13- by 9- by 2-inch baking pan, then add 1/2cup water and cover pan tightly with foil. Roast onions in middle of oven until tender but not falling apart, 25 to 30 minutes. ",
    "Stuff and bake onions: Reduce oven temperature to 350\u00c2\u00b0F. Transfer shells to a work surface and pour off water in pan. Fill shells with stuffing, mounding it, and return to pan. Reserve 5 to 7 cups stuffing for turkey cavity, then put remaining stuffing in a buttered shallow 3 1/2-quart baking dish and drizzle with remaining 1/4 cup stock. ",
