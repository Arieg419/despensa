    "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F (218\u00b0C).Toss peaches with blueberries, sugar, flour, lemon juice, cinnamon and salt in the bottom of a 2-quart ovenproof dish.",
    "Make the biscuit dough: Stir together the flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder and salt. Cut the butter into the dry mixture with your fingertips, a fork or a pastry blender. Stir in buttermilk with a rubber spatula until a wet, tacky dough comes together.",
    "Plop spoonfuls of the biscuit dough over the filling; don\u2019t worry about covering entire surface. Bake until the cobbler\u2019s syrup is bubbly and the biscuit tops are browned, about 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool slightly and scoop it into bowls. Top with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, of if you\u2019re having an accidental run-in with this cobbler before noon, plain yogurt.",
    "* Want to peel your peaches? Here\u2019s how: Cut a small \u201cx\u201d in the bottom of each peach. Dip them in boiling water for 30 seconds, and the skins will slide right off."
