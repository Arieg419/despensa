    "Pur\u00e9e blackberries and sugar in a blender until as liquefied as possible. Strain pur\u00e9e through a fine-mesh sieve or tea strainer into two tall or collins-style glasses; discard seeds in sieve. Divide gin and lime juice between glasses and stir to combine. Add ice to glasses then top each with soda and a sprig of basil or wedge of lime. (Might need another quick stir to combine.) Share with someone you like. "
