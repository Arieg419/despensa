    "Melt chocolate in a small/medium saucepan over very low heat, stirring constantly and not letting it cook a moment beyond its melted point. Remove from heat. Stir in cocoa and 2 tablespoons sugar. Drizzle in 1/2 cup milk very slowly, whisking the whole time. If any chocolate firms up, return the saucepan to a low stove, warming and whisking the mixture until it melts again. ",
    "Off the heat, stir in the remaining 1 cup of cold milk, which should make the chocolate base cold. If not, let it chill in the freezer for a few minutes to hasten the cooling along. ",
    "Beat heavy cream with remaining 2 teaspoons sugar until soft peaks form. You can do this vigorously by hand or with an electric mixer.",
    "In a blender, combine ice and chocolate-milk mixture until as smooth as a frozen cocktail. Pour into a glass \u2014 a goblet is traditional at the restaurant, but any glass you have will do \u2014 dollop with whipped cream and finish with shaved chocolate. Serve with a straw and a spoon."
