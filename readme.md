# Despensa

Despensa is a mobile application built in React Native. It allows you to search for recipes based on ingredients available in your home.

## What's left
The UI is pretty much done. Currently I am scraping and cleaning all the data that will be used within the app. Redux still needs to be implemented, preferrably with mock data / API. This way when I am done cleaning the data I can just plug it in.

## Screens
* [Despensa Home](#despensahome)
* [Despensa Discover](#despensadiscover)
* [Despensa Discover Category](#despensadiscovercategory)
* [Despensa Discover Dish](#despensadiscoverdish)
* [Despensa Ask](#despensaask)
* [Despensa Favorites](#despensafavorites)
* [Despensa Search](#despensasearch)
* [Despensa Add a Recipe](#despensaaddarecipe)


## <a name="despensahome"></a>Home
This screen will load a list of recipes for the 3 rows. A json file already exists for this. Data needs to be loaded via Redux.

## <a name="despensadiscover"></a>Discover
A json file already exists for this as well. Needs to be loaded via Redux.

## <a name="despensaask"></a>Ask
This would ideally write to a local JSON file. Needs to be done via Redux.

## <a name="despensafavorites"></a>Favorites
Unnecessary for now.

## <a name="despensasearch"></a>Search
This would search the json file of recipes for a match. Needs to be done via Redux.
