    "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with a heavy baking sheet or pizza stone on a middle rack.",
    "Whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in center, then add water and oil and gradually stir into flour with a wooden spoon until a dough forms. Knead dough gently on a work surface 4 or 5 times. It will feel quite oily (but just think of how great your hands will look later!). ",
    "Divide dough into 4 pieces and roll out 1 piece at on a sheet of parchment paper into a longish irregular rustic shape; mine were about 12\u2033x6\u2033. The dough should be rolled thin and it be crazy oily and you\u2019ll think I\u2019ve lost my mind suggesting that it will make anything but a mess, but you\u2019ll see in a few minutes how perfectly ungreasy it bakes up, promise.",
    "Slide rolled out dough and parchment paper together onto the preheated baking sheet or stone, and bake about 5 minutes, until lightly golden. Leaving the oven on, remove tray from oven and quickly sprinkle with 1/4 of grated cheese. Bake an additional 3 to 4 minutes, until browned at edges and in thinner spots. Remove flatbreads from oven a final time, quickly drizzle each with honey (1 used about a tablespoon per flatbread, but the restaurant used more; they were truly flooded with honey and it was delicious), sprinkle with sea salt and garnish with thyme leaves. Cut each cracker width-wise into 4 sections (about 3\u2033x6\u2033 each) with a sharp knife. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough. Serve warm.",
    "Do ahead: Should you want to prepare these ahead of time for a party, I\u2019d bake them including the cheese about 1 minute less than needed. Shortly before you\u2019re ready to serve them, re-toast them in the oven and then drizzle on the honey/thyme/sea salt. "
