    "First, cook the chorizo. Heat a medium-sized stainless steel saucepan over medium-high heat and add two tablespoons of oil. Add the chorizo and cook, stirring frequently, until the chorizo is golden and cooked through, about ten minutes. Add the eggs and after a minute, the chips. Use a wooden spoon to crush the chips as you stir to cook the eggs. Cook for about five minutes (mine took less) or until almost cooked through.Remove from heat.",
    "[Deb note: I\u2019m a stickler about not overcooking/drying out scrambled eggs \u2014 blech \u2014 and always remove them from the heat while they still look a little damp; they continue cooking in their residual heat even once plated.]",
    "Set up four plates for serving. Ladle some coulis in the bottom of each dish, top with some of the egg mixture and sprinkle with the cilantro. Serve immediately."
