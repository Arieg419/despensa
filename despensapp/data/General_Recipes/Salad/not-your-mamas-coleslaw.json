    "Make the dressing: Mix the mayonnaise, mustards, vinegar, celery seed, salt, and pepper in a smaller bowl. Stir in blue cheese, if using.",
    "Prepare the vegetables: Halve the cabbage halves and cut out the cores. Slice the cabbage as thinly as you can with a sharp knife, on a mandoline, or with a food processor\u2019s slicing blade (lay the cabbage horizontally in the feed tube). Transfer chopped cabbage into a large bowl, fishing out any very large pieces and slicing them thinly by hand. Stir in the shredded carrot. If you\u2019re going to dress this later, this is the best stopping point.",
    "To serve: Up to an hour before you\u2019ll eat the slaw, toss the cabbage mixture with dressing to taste \u2013- you will want to start with half and add more as needed \u2014 and parsley. Adjust seasonings as needed.",
    "Note: No matter how gargantuan the salad looks right now, it will soon wilt down a bit and yield moderate portions for 8 to 10 people.\n"
