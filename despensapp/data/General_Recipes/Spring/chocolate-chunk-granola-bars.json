    "Heat oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Line an 8-by-8 inch square pan with two sheets of parchment paper, extending each up two sides, forming a \u201csling\u201d for your bars to make them easy to remove.",
    "In a large bowl, combine oats, oat flour or ground oats, coconut, millet, salt, cinnamon (if using), dried fruit and chocolate. In a separate, small bowl, whisk together sunflower seed butter, oil and sweetener of choice until smooth. Pour wet mixture into dry and stir until combined. Transfer to prepared pan, spreading until flat, then use an addition square of parchment paper to protect your hand as you press, press, press the ingredients tightly into all corners of the pan, until they can be pressed no flatter.",
    "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the tops are golden and the edges are light brown. Let cool completely before cutting; they\u2019ll be even easier to cut without crumbling if you chill them in the fridge first, so feel free to cool them there. Once cool, use the parchment \u201csling\u201d to lift bars from pan and transfer to cutting board. Use a sharp, serrated knife in a very gentle sawing motion to cut bars into desired sizes (I usually go for 16 2\u00d72-inch squares). ",
    "Bars will keep at room temperature for up to a week in an airtight container, but I prefer to freeze them, individually wrapped, until needed. They only need to be out of the freezer for about an hour to fully defrost. "
