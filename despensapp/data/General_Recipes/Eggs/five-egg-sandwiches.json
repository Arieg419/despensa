    "Preheat your oven to warm and place a tray on a middle rack.",
    "Make waffles: Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, sugar and salt in a medium bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk together buttermilk, butter and egg. Stir wet ingredients and grated cheese into the dry mixture until combined. ",
    "Make waffles according to your manufacturer\u2019s directions. In the waffle iron I used \u2013 a thin one that made 6 rectangular waffles per batch \u2013 I cooked the waffles on the middle heat setting and needed 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 cups batter per batch. I made about 1 1/2 batches, yielding 9 small waffles. ",
    "Transfer waffles to tray in warmed oven and leave them there while you cook your greens.",
    "Prepare creamed greens: Wash greens but no need to dry them. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the greens until wilted. For baby spinach, we prefer it just barely wilted, which takes just a minute. For heartier greens, you\u2019ll want to cook them a few minutes longer. Transfer greens to a colander and press out as much extra liquid as you can. If desired, coarsely chop greens. ",
    "Wipe out pan and return it to medium heat. Melt butter and then cook onion until soft and tender, about 5 minutes. Return greens to pan and drizzle heavy cream over them. Cook, stirring, until cream simmers for a minute and mixture is evenly combined. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside.",
    "Poach eggs: Poach eggs according to your favorite method. If you don\u2019t have one, here\u2019s mine: Heat a saucepan with a few couple inches of water to the point right before it simmers. Using a cooking spoon, create a whirlpool and crack your egg right into the center of it and stop swirling. The egg should mostly wrap around itself. Continue to let the egg cook, keeping the water from fully simmering, until the white is firmed up but it the egg still jiggles from the middle when nudged with a spoon, about 3 to 4 minutes. Scoop out with a slotted spoon and repeat with remaining eggs.",
    "Assemble sandwiches: Place one square or wedge of waffle on a plate. Top with 1/4 of the creamed greens and a single poached egg. Dash with hot sauce, if desired, or a scattering of chopped tomatoes. Top with a second square or wedge of waffle and eat, precariously. "
