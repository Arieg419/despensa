    "Preheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, salt and baking soda in large bowl to blend. Using fingertips, rub 3/4 cup chilled butter into dry ingredients until mixture resembles coarse meal. Stir in chives. Add buttermilk and stir until evenly moistened. Using 1/4 cup dough for each biscuit, drop biscuits onto baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.* Bake until biscuits are golden brown on top, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly. Serve warm. ",
    "* I\u2019m a sucker for the round, bumpy-edged biscuit shape so I rolled it out on well-floured counter and cut them with a 3\u2033 biscuit-cutter. Take care to handle the dough as little as humanly possible, so not to warm or soften it too much. "
