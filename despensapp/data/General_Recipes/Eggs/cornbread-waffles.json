    "Combine cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in the bottom of a medium bowl. In a smaller bowl, whisk molasses, butter, buttermilk and egg until combined. Pour into dry ingredients and stir to combine. Let batter rest for 10 minutes. Use this time to place a oven-safe cooling rack over a tray and heat oven to 200 degrees. Heat waffle iron according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions; I found a medium heat just fine here.",
    "Brush waffle iron with melted butter or coat with nonstick spray. Ladle in waffle batter, 1/4 cup at a time. (It makes 4 or so -inch finished waffles, cute ones made for an egg on top.) Cook until lightly browned and carefully transfer to rack in oven. They\u2019ll crisp as they set. Repeat with remaining batter. You should get 8 waffles out of this, ideal for 2 per person.\nWaffles keep well for 4 days in fridge and longer in freezer. Waffles re-crisp and come back to life in a warm oven."
