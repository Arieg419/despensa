    "To serve: Grated Parmesan or Romano cheese",
    "Bring a huge pot of salted water to a boil. Add pasta and five minutes before its cooking time is up, add the broccoli rabe. It will seem like too much for the water, but with a stir or two, the rabe should wilt and cook alongside the pasta. Drain rabe and pasta together and pour into serving bowl. In the same pot or a tiny one, heat the olive oil with the garlic, pepper flakes and Kosher salt over moderate heat, stirring frequently for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the garlic becomes lightly golden. Pour mixture over pasta and toss to evenly coat. Shower with freshly grated cheese and eat at once."

  "ingredient_list": [
    "1 pound pasta, whatever shape you like (but chunky ones will match up better with the rabe)",

    "1/2 cup olive oil",
    "5 garlic cloves, peeled and minced or pressed",
    "1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes, or more or less to taste",
    "About 1 heaping teaspoon Kosher salt (or more to taste)"
