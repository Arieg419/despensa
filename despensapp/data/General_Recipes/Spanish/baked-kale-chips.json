    "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F. Rinse and dry the kale, then remove the stems and tough center ribs. Cut into large pieces, toss with olive oil in a bowl then sprinkle with salt. Arrange leaves in a single layer on a large baking sheet (I needed two because mine are tiny; I also lined mine with parchment for easy clean-up but there\u2019s no reason that you must). Bake for 20 minutes, or until crisp. Place baking sheet on a rack to cool.",
    "Kale-Dusted Popcorn If you\u2019re making the chips with the intention to grind them up for popcorn, I\u2019d use less oil \u2014 perhaps half \u2014 so they grind without the \u201cpowder\u201d clumping. I ground a handful of my chips (about half) in a mortar and pestle (well, actually the \u201cpestle\u201d was MIA so I used the handle of an OXO reamer, not that anyone asked) and sprinkled it over popcorn (1/4 cup popcorn kernels I\u2019d cooked in a covered pot with 1 1/2 tablespoons oil over medium heat, shaking it about with potholders frequently). I seasoned the popcorn with salt. I liked this snack, but I think Parmesan and Kale-Dusted Popcorn would be even more delicious. Next time!"
