    "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F. In a medium skillet, cook the bacon over medium heat until the fat is rendered and the bacon crisps up. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Add onion to skillet and cook until softened and beginning to caramelize, an amount of time I forgot to write down but would estimate at 7 to 10 minutes.",
    "Whisk together (or blend together in a food processor, if you want it silky-smooth) fromage blanc and cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche with flour, then season with salt and freshly ground black pepper.",
    "Divide the dough into 4 pieces. Roll each piece out to a rough 8-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. If the dough becomes difficult to roll, let it rest for 10 minutes, then continue.",
    "Oil two large baking sheets. Transfer two dough rounds to each. Spread the fromage blanc mixture over the rounds to within 1/4 inch of the edge. Sprinkle with the bacon and onion. Bake on the bottom shelf of the oven for about 12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Cut into wedges and serve."
