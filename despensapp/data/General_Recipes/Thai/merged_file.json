The eggs will hiss, sputter and the whites should puff and develop translucent bubbles. Once they\u2019re very crispy and a deep golden brown underneath, 45 seconds to 1 minute, use a thin spatula to flip the eggs, trying not to break the yolks but not fretting if it happens. Cook for another minute on the second side, until the yolks are set but still slightly molten (aim to have them a little less loose than mine, shown above). Transfer eggs to paper towels; you can cook them up to 15 minutes before serving. Discard oil and wipe out wok or skillet.",

            "Finish and serve: Pour the hot dressing over the salad and eggs. Stir gently to combine. If you\u2019re feeling fancy, transfer the salad, liquid at all, to a plate in a low heap. Eat at once."

            "To grill the chicken: [Lacking a grill, I did not test this method but I will be happy to if you invite me over tonight, okay?] Light a grill. If using a gas grill, turn off the center burners; if using a charcoal grill, once the coals are covered with a light ash, push them to opposite sides, forming a well in the middle. Set a disposable drip pan in the center. Cook chicken on the hot grate above, skin side down, with the cover down for about 40 minutes.

Anyway, I often see low-sodium soy sauce suggested as an alternative but I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s a fair swap. There\u2019s something more caramelized and fermented in the fish sauce that you\u2019d miss. If you feel like playing around, I might whisk some additional hoisin or even miso into that soy sauce for a more complex flavor.", 
            "** To ensure your chicken is \u201ccooked through\u201d: Lacking x-ray vision and decades of chicken-cooking practice, I\u2019m a big fan of using a thermometer to ensure that my meat is properly cooked. A thermometer inserted into the thigh/leg joint should register 180 to 185 degrees if you\u2019re following Proper Chicken Cooking Protocol, or 170 to 175 degrees, if you\u2019re me, and have very specific chicken-cooking preferences despite what food safety experts advise. I like to live on the edge, obviously. Another classic, though less precise way, to see if chicken is cooked through is to pierce it with a knife. If the juices that run out are clear, your chicken should be just right."
