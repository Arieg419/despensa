    "\nCombine maple syrup, sugar, water, vanilla and salt in a small saucepan and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar and salt. Remove from heat and let cool to lukewarm.\nMeanwhile combine cinnamon (if using), oats, almonds, coconut, seeds, almond or hazelnut flour in a large bowl.\nHeat oven to 325 degrees. Line a rimmed half-sheet (13\u00d718-inch) pan with parchment paper or a silicone mat.\nOnce liquid mixture is back to room temperature, whisk in olive oil, which will cool it further, then egg white. Pour over dry ingredients and mix well.",
    "Spread mixture evenly across the prepared baking sheet. Press down firmly to compact it before baking, using another same-size baking sheet or the bottom of a pot. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, until dark golden brown, rotating the sheet every 15 minutes to promote even browning. While it bakes, open the oven door a few times to release steam.\nSet on a cooling rack until surface of granola is crisp. Leave oven on. If surface is still tacky to the touch once it has cooled \u2014 although I didn\u2019t find this at all \u2014 return the pan to the oven and continue baking for another 10 to 15 minutes, checking every 5 minutes. Don\u2019t let it get too dark or it tastes bitter.\nOnce totally cool, break into pieces in store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 weeks, or in the fridge up to 1 month.\n"
