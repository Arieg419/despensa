            "2.\tStrain the soaking liquid through a coffee filter to remove grit and reserve, along with the reconstituted mushrooms, until needed.", 
            "3.\tHeat the olive oil in a large pot over a medium flame. Bundle the rosemary and sage together and tie with kitchen twine.  When the oil is hot, add the herb bundle and sizzle for a few minutes on both sides to infuse the oil.", 
            "4.\tAdd the onion, garlic, salt and pepper and cook for 5 minutes, until the onion is soft and translucent but not brown.", 
            "5.\tTurn the flame to high and add the white mushrooms and shitakes.", 
            "6.\tCook for 10 minutes, during which the mushrooms will give off their liquid (which should evaporate quickly due to the high heat) and deflate significantly. Stir occasionally.", 
            "7.\tAdd the chicken stock and the dried mushrooms along with the soaking water.", 
            "8.\tSimmer for 30 minutes. Remove the herbs, then add the cream and butter. Working in batches, puree the soup in a blender until smooth. Return to the pot and keep at a very low simmer until ready to serve.", 
            "Deb adjustments: I used far less olive oil, replaced some of the chicken stock with beef, as I had it on hand and love mixing that flavor with mushrooms; half as much cream, preferring a more potent soup and thyme instead of rosemary, also due to personal preference."

Stir occasionally, crushing the tomatoes against the side of the pot with a wooden spoon.

If it is bland, add a little salt and pepper and toss again.",

Scrape into the bread and fold to combine. Drain the plumped currants and fold them in, along with the pine nuts, if they were not already mixed with the bread scraps from the broiling step. Dribble the chicken stock or lightly salted water over the salad and fold again.",

If you want to serve it separately, do the same, but in a 1-quart shallow baking dish. Hang onto the bowl you mixed it in \u2014 you\u2019ll use it again.",

Drizzle and toss with a spoonful of the pan juices. Add the greens, a drizzle of vinaigrette, and fold well. Taste again."
