    "Preheat oven to 300\u00b0F and place racks in the upper and lower thirds of your oven. Line two large sheet pans with parchment paper.",
    "Pulse almond paste, sugar and salt in a food processor until broken up, then add egg whites and puree until smooth. Transfer batter to pastry bag fitted with a 3/8-inch tip and pipe 3/4-inch rounds (1/3 inch high) about 1-inch apart in pans. Dip a fingertip in water and gently tamp down any peaks.",
    "Bake, rotating and switching position of pans halfway through, until golden and puffed, 15 to 18 minutes.",
    "[When you rotate the pan midway through baking, you\u2019ll wonder why you left so much space between the cookies. Suddenly, at 15 minutes they\u2019ll puff up and you\u2019ll be happy you left that space!]",
    "Let cookies cool almost completely in their pans. Once cool, they\u2019re much easier to cleanly remove from the parchment. You can make them into sandwich cookies but spreading some jam (I used raspberry) between them or ganache (3 ounces of semi-sweet chips melted with 1 to 2 tablespoons of cream, then left to thicken a bit would be enough to sandwich the whole batch).",
    "Cookies can be kept in an airtight container at room temperature for a day or two or frozen up to one month."
