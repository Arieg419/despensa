  "directions": [
    "1. Mix the eggs with the milk or yogurt in a large bowl.",
    "2. In a smaller bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar together.",
    "3. Combine the wet and the dry ingredients and stir in the apples and whatever other flavorings you see fit.",
    "4. Heat a thin layer of oil in a skillet over low to medium heat. Drop large spoonful of batter into the pan and flatten it out a little (otherwise, you might have trouble getting them to cook in the center) and cook until golden brown underneath. Flip the pancakes and cook them for an additional two or three minutes.",
    "5. Either dust with powdered sugar and serve immediately, or keep on a tray in a warmed oven until you are ready to serve them."
