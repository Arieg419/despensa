    "\nMix the onion, jalape\u00f1o and cilantro in the bottom of a medium bowl. Add lime and salt. Cut avocado in half and remove the pit. Use a knife to score each half in a grid pattern, being careful not to cut through the skin of the avocado. Run a soup  spoon between the avocado and skin to scoop the chunks cleanly into the bowl. Turn them over a few times to coat them with the dressing. Taste mixture, adding more of other ingredients to taste. Use a fork to mash chunks to desired consistency, or not at all. Try not to eat this bowl by yourself, although it will be hard.\n"
