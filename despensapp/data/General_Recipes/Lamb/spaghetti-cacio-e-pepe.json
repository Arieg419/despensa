    "Cook spaghetti in well-salted water to your al dente tastes in a large, wide-bottomed pot. (You\u2019ll have fewer dishes to wash if you use this pot to assemble the dish as well.) Drain spaghetti, reserving 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water.",
    "Dry out your pot, then heat the olive oil over high heat until almost smoking. Add drained spaghetti and 1 cup of reserved pasta water and jump back, this will splatter mightily, also known as \u201cI made this three times, and never once learned my lesson. Do as I say, not as I do.\u201d",
    "Add butter, 3 ounces cheese and ground pepper and toss together with tongs. Taste, adding more pasta water, cheese, pepper or salt (which should not be neccessary, as Romano is very salty) to taste.",
    "Serve immediately, sprinkling with reserved cheese and an extra grind or two of black pepper."
