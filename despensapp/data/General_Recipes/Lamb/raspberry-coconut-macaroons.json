    "Preheat oven to 325\u00b0F. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "In a food processor, blend the coconut for a minute. Add sugar, blend another minute. Add egg whites, salt and almond extract and blend for another minute. Add raspberries and pulse machine on and off in short bursts until they are largely, but not fully, broken down. (I counted 13 pulses. I might have been a little obsessive, what with the counting.) Some visible flecks of raspberry here and there are great. When you open the machine, you\u2019ll see some parts of the batter that are still fully white while others are fully pink. Resist stirring them together.",
    "With a tablespoon measure or cookie scoop (I used a #70), scoop batter into 1-inch mounds. You can arrange the cookies fairly close together as they don\u2019t spread, just puff a bit. Scooping a little of the pink batter and a little of the white batter together makes them look extra marble-y and pretty.",
    "Bake cookies for 25 to 30 minutes, until they look a little toasted on top. Let them rest on the tray for 10 minutes after baking (or you can let them fully cool in place, if you\u2019re not in a rush to use the tray again), as they\u2019ll be hard to move right out of the oven. They\u2019ll firm up as they cool, but still remain softer and less dry inside than traditional macaroons. Thank goodness."
