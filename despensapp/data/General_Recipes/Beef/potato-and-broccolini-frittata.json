    "Place the potatoes and broth in a large, ovenproof frying pan, ideally one that is 12 inches. Bring to a boil and simmer for 10 minutes, turning the potatoes often, until almost all of the stock has been absorbed and the potatoes are tender. ",
    "Add olive oil, broccolini and onion to the potatoes in the frying pan and cook over medium heat for 1 minute, turning frequently, just to get everything coated with oil, Then, reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, cooking for 3 to 4 more minutes, or until the broccolini has become mostly tender.",
    "Heat your broiler.",
    "Beat eggs with half the parmesan, salt and pepper, and pour it over the vegetables in the frying pan. Cover and cook over medium (or medium-low, if yours seems to be browning too quickly) until the eggs are mostly, set. Sprinkle remaining parmesan over frittata and run the whole pan under the broiler, until the top is bronzed and the eggs are just set throughout, approximately 5 minutes, but this could vary due to how robust your broiler is (mine is terrible; it took longer).",
    "Let cool slightly before slicing into wedges or squares."
