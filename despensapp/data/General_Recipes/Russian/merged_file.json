Sprinkle half of the parsley, chives, scallions and shallot on top. Let cool for 2 minutes, slice and serve immediately. Prepare the second pizza in the same way.", 
            "* The original recipe suggests that you take the dough out one hour before baking but I took mine out two hours earlier, because I always find it takes a looong time to get dough back to proofing at room temperature. In this time, you can lazily prepare the toppings and get your oven nice and hot."

(You\u2019ll want to chop your butter into small bits first, unless you\u2019re using a very strong pastry blender in which case you can throw the sticks in whole, as I do.) Gently stir in the water with a rubber spatula, mixing it until a craggy mass forms. Get your hands in the bowl and knead it just two or three times to form a ball. Divide dough roughly in half (it\u2019s okay if one is slightly larger). Wrap each half in plastic wrap and flatten a bit, like a disc. Chill in fridge for at least an hour or up to two days or slip plastic-wrapped dough into a freezer bag and freeze for up to 1 to 2 months (longer if you trust your freezer more than I do).

Baked slab pie will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. Squares can be reheated as needed.

Arrange eggplants cut side down; sprinkle with more salt and pepper. Roast for 25 minutes on the first side, or until brown underneath then flip and roast 5 to 10 minutes more. Remove from oven and let cool slightly.\nMeanwhile, make couscous, if using it. Bring 3/4 cup water and a few pinches of salt to a simmer then pour it over dried couscous in a bowl. Cover with a lid or foil and let side for 5 minutes to absorb, then fluff with a fork.\nMake tomato relish by pulsing garlic and parsley in a blender or food processor until finely chopped, then add tomatoes and pulse until they\u2019re well chopped. Add 1 tablespoon olive oil, vinegar, salt, freshly ground black pepper or a pinch or two of red pepper flakes and pulse to combine. No food process or blender? Not a problem at all; just mince the garlic and parsley well and finely chop the tomatoes; stir this together with the remaining ingredients. Both methods: taste for seasoning. We like this extra sharp and almost always add 1 more teaspoon vinegar and more salt. The longer it sits, the more potent it gets.\nTo assemble, schmear each eggplant half with a little yogurt. If you\u2019re using couscous, sprinkle a little on top. Spoon tomato relish over and serve the rest of all the above on the side."

            "The day before, get ready: Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Get 2 baking sheets (or even better, round pizza pans) down, more if you have them. Tear off 6 sheets of parchment paper large enough to have a 9-inch circle on it.\nMake cookie/cake dough: In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the sugar, honey and butter over medium heat. Once simmering, cook for 3 to 4 minutes (no specific temperature needed), it should get a faint shade darker and smell wonderful. Whisk in baking soda.\nRemove from heat and set aside for 2 to 3 minutes. It\u2019s not going to significantly cool off, just settle a little. Lightly beat your eggs in a spouted measuring cup (for easiest pouring) or small bowl. Take a deep breath. Whisking the honey mixture vigorously in the pot the whole time, drizzle the thinnest stream (think: 1/2 teaspoon at a time, that slowly) of the eggs into the honey mixture. Do not stop mixing. Continue until all of the eggs are thoroughly whisked in.\nStir in the salt and vanilla and 3 cups (390 grams) of the flour with a spoon. The dough is going to be thick like a bread but you\u2019ve got this. Stir in the last 1/2 cup of flour 1/4 cup at a time; you\u2019ll get a bonus arm workout.\nShape and bake the cookies/cakes: [Plus, a bunch more layer tips at the end.] Lightly flour your counter and divide the still-warm dough into 8 even pieces. Roll the first one between two sheets of parchment paper (no flouring needed) to a slightly-bigger-than-9-inch round. Remove top sheet of parchment paper. Very lightly dust the top with flour if you\u2019re going to put something on it (such as the bottom of a 9-inch cake pan or the rim of a 9-inch bowl) to trim the shape to an even 9-inch circle. Save the trimmings \u2014 put them aside on one of the sheets of parchment paper, it\u2019s fine if they overlap a little. Dock the circle all over with a fork. Slide your 9-inch round onto a baking sheet and bake for 6 to 7 minutes; it should feel firmish and get slightly darker at the edges. Slide the cookie onto a cooling rack. Go ahead and reuse the parchment for another layer.\nMeanwhile, while the first layer is baking, roll out your second piece so it\u2019s ready to go into the oven as soon as the first comes out. If you\u2019re making good time, get the third ready too and continue to bake them two at a time. Keep adding the unbaked cookie trimmings onto one piece of parchment paper. Repeat this process as you bake each round and you\u2019ll have all 8 baked before you know it.\nFinally, take that last sheet of parchment with all of the cookie scraps on it and slide it onto a baking sheet and bake it, checking in at 4 minutes, because the thinnest scraps will want to burn quickly. By 5 minutes, all should be baked until pale golden. Let cool completely and save until you\u2019re ready to decorate the cake tomorrow.\nFill and frost the cake: Whisk sour cream and sweetened condensed milk together in a large bowl. Once cookies are cool, place a dab of the sour cream mixture on your cake plate and place the first cookie on top of it to help adhere it.\nCut or tear one of your used pieces of parchment paper into strips and tuck them all around the underside of the cake to protect your cake plate. Trust me, if you do not do this, you will regret it.\nScoop 3/4 cup sour cream mixture onto the center of your first cookie layer. Spread it only a little from the center, leaving a good 1- to 2-inch margin of unfrosted cookie. Stack the second cookie on top and repeat until you have 8 layers.\nThis will quickly become a huge mess. The sour cream is going to spill out and down the sides anyway (hear hear for those paper strips) and you\u2019re going to start yelling at me/drafting an angry comment in your head. It\u2019s also going to want to slide around and not stay neatly stacked. It\u2019s totally okay because the filling will thicken as it absorbs into the cookies. Put the cake in the fridge for a couple hours (1 to 3) and when you come back to it, nudge the stack gently back into place and use a spoon and icing spatula to scoop the spilled-out filling back up the sides and onto the top of the cake. Don\u2019t worry about it looking neat. Let it chill overnight.\nThe next day, finish the cake: Grind your baked, reserved cookie scraps in a blender or food processor, or bash them into crumbs in a bag with a rolling pin.\nTake your cake out and do one final frosting clean-up. Spread any newly puddled sour cream back up the sides and across the top. If you\u2019d like to make a decoration on top of your cake, take one of those used pieces of parchment paper (see how much Deb hates wasting parchment) and cut a stencil with it. Place it gently on top of the cake.\nUse a small spoon to sprinkle the top and sides of the cake with the crumbs. In the coolest trick I saw on a cooking video, use a pastry brush (or extremely clean paintbrush, I won\u2019t tell) to gently brush the crumbs off the stencil and across the cake in a thin layer. It sounds crazy but it works \u2014 on the sides too. Remove the stencil and parchment paper strips and look at that clean serving plate! (Bravo, you.)\nYou can serve the cake right away, or keep it in the fridge for up to 5 days. When slicing, I found that a knife dipped in hot water made picture-perfect cuts.\nA bunch of extra dough and cake layer tips:The dough is a bit stiff, but it will stretch to the size you need with pressure. If you\u2019re finding it to be a huge pain, that the dough clearly wants to go to 8 inches but not 9, just go ahead and make the cake 8 inches round. It will be just as good of a cake; the layers might need a single extra minute to bake.Ovens will vary, especially for such thin cookies, so keep an eye on the first round as of the 6-minute mark, checking in each minute after as it can brown very quickly, and then you\u2019ll know how much time you need for the remaining ones.This dough is easiest to roll/softest when it\u2019s still a little warm; if yours has cooled quickly, I found that you could put each piece in the microwave for 5 to 7 seconds (only!) to get it a touch warmer again, without prematurely baking the cookie.Go ahead and save all of those used pieces of parchment paper for the next step and beyond. We\u2019re going to use them again."

Previous to last week, I wouldn\u2019t say we\u2019ve exactly mastered the art of family vacations. Sure, we always have fun together but it often either feels like we\u2019re either someplace exciting for adults but less so for little kid, or someplace awesome for a little kid but it feels more like this for the adults. This may not be for everyone, but at least for now, the resolution turned out to be a place where us grownups could lay on the beach, reading books, napping, and being total slackers for most of the day while the kid attended a day camp with everything from pony rides to water slides, trapeze school and circus training and also a pirate-themed treasure hunt for \u2026 underwear which if you\u2019ve ever been around 4 and 5 year-olds, know was the greatest. We\u2019d retrieve our kid, sticky with ice cream, chocolate pastries and sugar cereals from his mid-afternoon go\u00fbter and then play on the beach or in the pool for a couple hours before dinner, stories, bed and everybody won.

It turned out \u2014 you know, along with some Sunday night soup dumplings \u2014 all day, if you can scrounge a few staples together. Before vacation, when I was deep in my 2nd Trimester Carb Immersion Plan, I fell in love on sight alone with a dish called Rhonda\u2019s Spaghetti with Fried Eggs with Pangritata for One on Food52.

But here, since we boil the egg and then prepare the rest of the toast, it continues to cook and firm up a bit in its shell, so I\u2019ve found that a 5 to 5 1/2 minute egg will give you the equivalent in the end."

Add potatoes and onions in even layers and reduce heat to medium-low. Cook for 15 minutes, flipping and nudging potatoes around to ensure they cook evenly. Potatoes are done when they are tender when pierced with the tip of a knife.

Or start cracking those eggs\u2026]\nMake the tortilla batter: In the bottom of a large bowl, lightly beat eggs with a couple good pinches of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Stir in drained potatoes and onions. If you have 10 minutes, definitely let them soak together for that long; it makes a difference in how well the finally tortilla stays together.

Pour potato mixture into skillet and flatten the potatoes with a spatula until they\u2019re mostly even. Reduce heat to medium-low.
