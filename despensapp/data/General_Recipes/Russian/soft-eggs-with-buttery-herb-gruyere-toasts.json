    "Make croutons: Preheat oven to 400\u00b0F. Place bread cubes in shallow, wide bowl. Whisk together butter and Dijon, then pour over bread fingers. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, both types of cheese, parsley and thyme, if using. Toss to coat. Spray rimmed baking sheet with nonstick spray. Scatter bread on sheet. Bake croutons until crisp and golden, turning, about 20 minutes. Set aside. ",
    "Meanwhile, cook eggs: Bring a medium pot of water to a steady boil. Add eggs and cook them for exactly six minutes, maintaining the heat at a simmer, then drain and rinse them briefly in cold water. ",
    "Holding the egg vertically, pointier side down, with a towel or paper towel to protect you from its heat, tap a knife around the \u201cneck,\u201d about half an inch below the top so that you can remove a little \u201clid\u201d area. Place the egg in a small dish, opened side up, and serve with a small spoon and toast soldiers.",
    "Don\u2019t have adorable chicken or other tiny egg cups and spoons? With a little patience, you can peel the soft-boiled eggs as you would a hard-boiled one. It\u2019s tricky, because they are liquid in the center, but doable. For this method, arrange four of your croutons on a small plate. Place the peeled egg over the croutons and smash it lightly, delightfully (if you don\u2019t find this to be really fun, I am not sure we can be friends) with a fork. Season with salt and pepper and eat with a fork and knife."
