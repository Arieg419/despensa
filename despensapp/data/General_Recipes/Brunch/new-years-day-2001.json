    "1.\tGenerously grease a 9\u00d713-inch baking dish with salted (my choice) or unsalted butter.",
    "2.\tArrange bread in two tightly-packed layers in the pan. I always cut one slice into smaller pieces to fill in gaps, especially when using braided Challah. If using a thinner-sliced bread, you might wish for more layers, though I find that over three, even baking can be difficult. If you are using any fillings of fruit or nuts, this is the time to get them between the layers or sprinkled atop.",
    "3.\tWhisk milk, eggs, sugar, salt and booze or flavorings of your choice and pour over the bread. Sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.",
    "4.\tWrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. The bread will absorb all of the milk custard while you sleep.",
    "5.\tBake at 425 for 30 minutes, or until puffed and golden. This will take longer if you have additional layers.",
    "6.\tCut into generous squares and serve with maple syrup, fresh fruit, powdered sugar or all of the above."
