    "Preheat oven to 375\u00b0F. Either grease 10 muffin cups with butter or coconut oil, or line them with papers. ",
    "[Oh, you\u2019re out of paper liners too? Cut parchment paper into 5-inch squares and form them into your empty muffin cups, pressing any creases flat. They won\u2019t stay put until you fill them with batter, and you should make sure you push that batter down so it gets into the corners, but otherwise, they should work as well as the real deal.] ",
    "In a small saucepan, warm your coconut oil just until it melts. It should still be on the cool side.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together your flours, baking powder and salt. Stir 1/2 cup shredded coconut. In a separate bowl, whisk together egg, sugar, coconut oil, yogurt and vanilla. Stir into dry ingredients until just combined. Divide batter among prepared muffin cups then sprinkle the top with remaining 1/4 cup coconut, about 1 to 2 teaspoons on each.  ",
    "Bake until a tester inserted into the center comes out batter-free, about 20 minutes. Transfer muffins to a rack and let cool.",
    "Do ahead: Usually, muffins are best on day one but I just had one of these on day three and found them almost as moist and tender as day one. Store in an airtight container at room temperature."
