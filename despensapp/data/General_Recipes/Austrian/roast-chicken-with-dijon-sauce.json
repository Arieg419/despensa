    "Preheat oven to 450\u00b0F with a rack in middle. Pat chicken dry and season generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Heat oil in an ovenproof 12-inch heavy skillet (if you\u2019ve got a cast iron skillet, it is great here) over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Working in 2 batches, brown chicken, skin side down first and turning once, about 5 minutes per batch. I like to take a lot of care in this step, not moving the chicken until the skin releases itself and has a nice bronze on it, which will provide the best flavor. ",
    "Return all chicken, skin side up, to skillet and roast in oven until just cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer chicken to a platter, then add shallots, wine, and broth to pan juices in skillet and boil, scraping up any brown bits, until reduced by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cream and boil until slightly thickened, about 1 minute. To thicken the sauce further, turn the heat to high and boil it until it reduces to a consistency you prefer.",
    "Strain sauce through a sieve into a bowl, if you\u2019re feeling fancy (I never am, but if you don\u2019t, you might find some chicken bits scraped up from the pan in your sauce. We don\u2019t mind.) Whisk in mustard, chives, and salt and pepper to taste. Serve chicken with sauce. "
