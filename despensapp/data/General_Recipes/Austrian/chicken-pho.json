    "In a small saucepan or large heavy skillet, heat the oil over medium-high until it registers 275\u00b0F on a deep-fry or candy thermometer. Add the shallots and cook, stirring frequently as they\u2019ll want to cook unevenly, until light golden brown, about 4 to 8 minutes, depending on their thickness. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.",
    "Increase the heat to high and place a fine-mesh sieve over a heatproof bowl. When the oil registers 375\u00b0F on the deep-fry or candy thermometer, add return the fried shallots to the oil and cook just until they are crispy and well-browned, about 5 seconds, watching carefully so the shallots don\u2019t burn.",
    "Pour the oil and shallots through the sieve to immediately stop the cooking, then transfer to shallots to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Sprinkle with salt to season. Reserve the oil for another use. The shallots will keep, stored in an airtight container, for 1 day, but they\u2019re best the day they are made."
