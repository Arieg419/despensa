    "Make the broth: ",
    "[On the stove] Combine all ingredients in a large (6 to 8 quart) stock pot over high heat and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce to a gentle simmer, skim any unpleasant looking foam (\u201cskim the scum\u201d is kitchen parlance for this step, but I\u2019m trying to be polite) and cover with a lid. Simmer for 2 1/2 hours. ",
    "[In a slow-cooker] Combine all ingredients in a large (6 quart or larger) slow-cooker. Cook on LOW for 10 hours or HIGH for 5. Strain into a large pot (5.5 quarts or more) and let rest in the fridge until needed, or, if you\u2019re finishing the soup right away, bring to a simmer on the stove. ",
    "Cook the chicken:",
    "[Both methods] Add whole chicken breasts to simmering broth. Simmer for 20 minutes, until they\u2019re cooked through, then strain broth [for stovetop method] or simply remove cooked chicken breasts [from the slow-cooker method] and set them aside. Taste broth, and adjust seasoning if needed. ",
    "Finish the soup:",
    "Add diced vegetables to simmering broth on stove and cook for 5 minutes, until firm-tender. Add soup noodles and cook according to package instructions, usually 6 to 10 minutes. Meanwhile, once chicken breasts are cool enough to handle, remove skin and bones and shred or chop into small chunks. Return chicken to soup and simmer for 2 minutes, until heated through. Finish with parsley and serve to some very lucky people. ",
    "To de-fat the broth: Once the broth portion is complete and the soup has settled a little, you can skim any fat that\u2019s accumulated at the surface with a soup skimmer or spoon, to taste. If you\u2019re going to chill the broth before finishing the soup another day, it\u2019s easiest to take the fat off right before you use it; it will have solidified at the surface. P.S. Don\u2019t toss it, please! It makes for wonderful matzo balls and fried latkes. "
