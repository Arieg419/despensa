    "Heat your oven\u2019s broiler. Line a large baking sheet with foil to limit the mess you make. Cut baguette lengthwise and arrange pieces cut side up in pan. Put butter, garlic, pepper flakes and salt in a small saucepan and melt over medium-high heat, stirring, until garlic is sizzling in the butter (but not browning). Remove from heat and stir in oregano, if using. Spoon evenly over bread. Sprinkle bread with parmesan, if using, and broil \u2014 keeping a close watch on it and turning it as needed for even coloring \u2014 for 2 to 3 minutes. Seriously, watch it like a hawk. Nothing\u2019s sadder than under- or over-cooked garlic bread. ",
    "Remove from oven, sprinkle with parsley and chives, if using, and cut into segments. We keep extras in foil in the fridge and rewarm them in the oven, but you know it\u2019s always best on the first day."
