    "Cook linguine or spaghetti in well-salted water to your al dente tastes in a large, wide-bottomed pot. (You\u2019ll have fewer dishes to wash if you use this pot to assemble the dish as well.) ",
    "While pasta is cooking, zest lemons until you have a little shy of a tablespoon of zest. Juice lemons \u2014 you\u2019ll have anywhere from 1/3 to 1/2 cup lemon juice.  ",
    "Drain pasta, reserving 1 1/2 cups of pasta cooking water. Dry out your pot, then boil the olive oil, cream, zest and 1 cup of the reserved pasta water together for two minutes over high heat.  Return pasta to pot and stir until coated. Add the cheese and 1/4 cup lemon juice and toss, toss, toss everything together. Add more pasta water, 1/4 cup at a time, if you\u2019d like your dish a little looser. Quickly taste a strand of pasta and see if you want to add the remaining lemon juice (we did). Stir in basil or arugula and season generously with salt and pepper. ",
    "Serve immediately, drizzling individual portions with a bit of extra olive oil and sprinkling with extra Parmesan cheese."
