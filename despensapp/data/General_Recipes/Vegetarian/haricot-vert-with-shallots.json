    "Bring a pot of well-salted water to boil. Boil haricot vert for 3.5 minutes (yes, I honestly believe that this level of timed precision will be rewarded). Plunge them into an ice bath and drain the beans.",
    "In your empty pot (because we\u2019re always looking to save dish-washing time in the smitten kitchen) melt two teaspoons of butter over medium heat. Add the shallot and saute them until they\u2019re just translucent, not browned\u2013about one to two minutes. Add the drained and cooled haricot vert back into the pot and reheat them in the butter and shallots. Season with salt and pepper. Spread haricot vert and shallot onto a plate, throw the diced tomato over them and squeeze a few drops of lemon juice* over the dish. Serve immediately. Eat with your fingers, if your name is Deb.",
    "* David notes that lemon juice discolors green beans and he\u2019s correct. But only if you don\u2019t eat them quickly, which in our case was a non-issue. "
