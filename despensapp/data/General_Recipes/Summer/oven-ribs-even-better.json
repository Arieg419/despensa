    "We\u2019ve also fiddled with combinations, such as a higher temperature at the beginning, and then, upon realizing they\u2019d be ready sooner than we\u2019d need them, turning them down to 175\u00b0F for the remaining time. And vice-versa, starting with the low temperatures in the original recipe, and realizing at the 4 hour mark, they were coming along too slowly and finishing them at 300\u00b0F. I hope these extra options make it easier, and not more confusing, to make yours at home."
