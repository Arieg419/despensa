    "Day 1: Make the bolognese sauce: In a food processor, pulse onion, carrots, celery, and garlic until finely chopped. Heat a moderate-sized Dutch oven (4 to 5 quarts) over medium-high heat. Once hot, coat the bottom of the pan with two to three tablespoons of oil. Once it is hot, add the chopped vegetables and season them generously with salt and pepper. Cook the vegetables until they are evenly brown, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes.",
    "I\u2019m going to insert my favorite Burrell-ism here: Brown food tastes good! Don\u2019t skimp on the cooking times as this creates the big flavors the will carry right through to your plated lasagna. And now I\u2019m going to insert my own-ism: Don\u2019t worry about sticking bits of food or uneven pieces or anything. It\u2019s all going to work out in the end.",
    "Add the ground beef and seasoning again with salt and pepper. Brown the beef well and again, don\u2019t rush this step. Cook for another 15 minutes. Add the tomato paste and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the red wine, using it to scrape up any stuck bits in the pan. Cook the wine until it has reduced by half, about 5 more minutes. Add water to the pan until the water is about 1 inch above the meat. Toss in the bay leaves and the bundle of thyme and stir to combine everything, bringing it to a low simmer.",
    "Here\u2019s how the next 3 to 4 hours will go: You\u2019ll keep a pitcher of water near the stove. You\u2019ll stir the sauce from time to time. As the water in the sauce cooks off, you\u2019ll want to add more but you don\u2019t want to add more than 1 to 2 cups at a time or you\u2019ll have boiled meat sauce (bleh) rather than something thick and robust with flavor. Taste it from time to time and add more seasoning if needed. Simmer for 3 to 4 hours.",
    "You\u2019ll have about 8 to 8 1/2 cups of sauce but will only need 4 for the lasagna. Discard the thyme and bay leaves and put half in the fridge for lasagna assembly tomorrow and the other half in the freezer for up to a couple months. Ours was still as good as day one after 6 weeks.",
    "Day 2: Make your pasta: Combine all of the pasta ingredients in a food processor. Run the machine until the mixture begins to form a ball. You\u2019re looking for a dough that is firm but not sticky. If needed, add water a drop at a time until it comes together. Place ball of dough on a lightly floured surface and invert a bowl over it. Let it rest for an hour. (You\u2019ll have about 10 ounces or a little less than 2/3 pound of fresh pasta dough.)",
    "Get your work area ready; I like to line a large tray with waxed paper. Dust the waxed paper with flour. Keep more waxed paper and flour nearby.",
    "Working with a quarter of the dough at a time, run in through your pasta roller on the widest setting (usually \u201c0\u201d), then repeat this process with the roller set increasingly smaller (1, 2, 3) until the pasta is very thin. My Atlas machine goes to 9 but I almost always stop at 8 because this setting makes for thin, delicate pasta that\u2019s not so fragile that I\u2019m pulling my hair out with frustration trying to move it around.",
    "If you find your dough sticking, lightly flour it. If it gets too big to handle, cut it in half. If the piece gets too wide for the machine or becomes annoyingly irregularly shaped, I re-\u201cfold\u201d the dough by folding the sides of the dough into the middle, like an envelope, and press it flat. Then, run the piece back through the machine with the open sides up and down on the widest setting again (0) working your way thinner. This allows the machine to \u201cpress\u201d any trapped air out.",
    "Lay your pasta on the floured waxed paper in a single layer, trying to keep the pieces from touching. Flour the tops of them and place another sheet of floured wax paper on top. Repeat this process with the remaining dough and as many layers of pasta you need.",
    "Next, cook your pasta: Cut your pasta lengths into square-ish shapes. The fun thing about making fresh pasta for lasagna is that the shape doesn\u2019t much matter; you\u2019re going to tile together whatever you have and nobody will care if it took 9 or 16 bits to patch the layer together. Bring a large pot of water to boil. Have ready a skimmer, a large bowl of ice water and a large tray or platter that you\u2019ve drizzled or spritzed with oil. Boil several of squares of noodle at a time for 1 to 2 minutes each (1 minute if you, indeed, went to the thinnest setting on your machine; 2 if you, like me, stopped one shy of thinnest). Scoop them out with your skimmer, swish them in the ice water and lay them out (still wet is fine) on the oiled platter. Repeat with remaining pasta. It\u2019s okay to have your noodles touch; they shouldn\u2019t stick together in the short period of time until you begin assembling but if you\u2019re nervous, you can drizzle or spritz each layer very lightly with more oil.",
    "Make your b\u00e9chamel: Melt your butter in the bottom of a medium-to-large saucepan over medium heat. Once melted, add your flour and stir it into the butter until smooth. Cook the mixture together for a minute, stirring constantly. Pour in a small drizzle of your milk*, whisking constantly into the butter-flour mixture until smooth. Continue to drizzle a very small amount at a time, whisking constantly. Once you\u2019ve added a little over half of your milk, you\u2019ll find that you have more of a thick sauce or batter, and you can start adding the milk in larger splashes, being sure to keep mixing. Once all of the milk is added, add the salt, garlic, nutmeg (if using) and few grinds of black pepper, and bring the mixture to a lower simmer and cook it, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings if needed.",
    "* Yes, cold is fine. I divert from the proper b\u00e9chamel method here as I\u2019ve found that as long as you add your milk slowly, you do not need to heat it separately first. Hooray for fewer steps and pots!",
    "At last, you may assemble your dish: Preheat oven to 400 degrees. In a 9\u00d713-inch or equivalent rectangular baking dish, spread a generous 1/4 cup of the b\u00e9chamel. I mostly use this to keep the noodles from sticking. Add your first layer of cooked noodles, patching and slightly overlapping them however is needed to form a single layer. Ladle 1 cup bolognese sauce over the noodles, spreading it evenly. Drizzle 1/2 cup b\u00e9chamel over the bolognese; don\u2019t worry about getting it perfectly smooth or even. Sprinkle the layer with 1/3 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat this process \u2014 pasta + 1 cup bolognese + 1/2 cup b\u00e9chamel + 1/3 cup parmesan \u2014 three more times, then add one more layer of pasta. You\u2019ll use 5 layers of pasta total.",
    "There are two ways to finish the dish. You can simply sprinkle the top layer of pasta with your remaining parmesan before baking. This makes the crunchiest lid. I like a semi-crunchy lid and first spread 1/4 cup b\u00e9chamel over the top layer of pasta before sprinkling it with the remaining cheese. It still gets crunchy \u2014 and has corners that are worth fighting over \u2014 but never unpleasantly so.",
    "Bake your lasagna for 30 to 45 minutes, until bubbly all over and browned on top. You should do absolutely nothing but put your feet up and drink a glass of wine while you do; you\u2019ve earned it. When it comes out of the oven, I like to let it rest for 10 minutes before serving it.",
    "Do ahead: Lasagna can be prepared right up until the baking point a day in advance, and kept wrapped in plastic in the fridge. Theoretically, you could also freeze it at this point but I haven\u2019t tried this. I\u2019ll update this to say \u201cgo for it\u201d if many people respond in the comments that they\u2019ve done so successfully. Lasagna will also reheat well for up to three days, possibly longer but in my apartment, we\u2019ve never had the chance to find out."
