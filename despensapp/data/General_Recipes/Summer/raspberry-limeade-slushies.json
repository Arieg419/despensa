    "In a blender, blend the lime juice, raspberries, water, ice and sugar until slushy. Pour into glasses. Top off with about 1/4 cup soda water and garnish with a lime wedge. Drink quickly enough to get a brain freeze.",
    "If you\u2019re averse to raspberry seeds (I generally am, but was feeling rushed that day), you can puree the berries first, press them through a fine-mesh strainer to remove the seeds, then put them back in the blender and add the rest of the ingredients. I will note that the seeds were far less annoying than I\u2019d expected them to be, likely because they\u2019re less noticeable with the added texture from the ice.",
    "Also: I probably don\u2019t need to tell you how good this would be with booze. "
