    "Really complicated directions: Toss together all ingredients in a large bowl until combined well.",
    "I like to eat mine on top of chopped Romaine lettuce, or with toasted pocketless pita wedges.",
    "Variations: Are almost endless, but this is particularly good with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and chopped pecans."

  "ingredient_list": [
    "4 cups cubed (1/2 inch) cooked chicken (about 1 3/4 lb) (I like to brine mine first, then poach it in water for 15 to 20 minutes because I am completely neurotic about chicken getting dried out in any way.)",
    "1 cup walnuts, toasted and chopped",
    "1 celery rib, diced into small bits (1 cup)",
    "2 or more tablespoons finely chopped shallot",
    "1 cup dried cranberries",
    "2/3 to 3/4 cup mayonnaise",
    "3 tablespoons tarragon vinegar, if you have it, or champagne or white wine vinegar works well, too",
    "2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh tarragon or herb or your choice",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/2 teaspoon black pepper"
