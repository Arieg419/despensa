    "A few hours before serving or, even better, the day before: Place potatoes in medium-sized pot and cover with a few inches of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 30 minutes. Drain and cool completely. (Overnight in the fridge makes this easy, and the potatoes even easier to slice cleanly the next day.)\nTo assemble and serve: Cut cooled potatoes into chunks and transfer to large bowl. Add pickles, celery, onion, and eggs. Combine mayonnaise, mustard, vinegar, and dill in a jar. Stir about half of dressing into salad, tossing to combine evenly. Add more dressing to taste, and season well with salt and pepper.",
    "Do ahead: Keep dressing and vegetables separate until just before serving. Potato salad keeps for up to 4 days in fridge. Leftover dressing should keep for a couple weeks."
