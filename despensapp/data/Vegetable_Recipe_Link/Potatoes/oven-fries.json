    "Heat oven to 450 degrees F.",
    "Peel your potatoes if you wish; scrub them well if you do not. Cut potatoes into just-shy-of 1/2-inch batons. Place in a large pot and cover with an inch or two of water. Set heat to high and set timer for 10 minutes. If potatoes come to a boil in this time (mine usually do not), reduce the heat to medium. Otherwise, when timer rings, whether or not the potatoes have boiled, test one. You\u2019re looking for a very \u201cal dente\u201d potato \u2014 one that is too firm to eat enjoyable, but has no crunch left. A good sign that they\u2019re not too cooked is when you roughly tumble them into a colander, only one or two break.",
    "Meanwhile, coat a large baking sheet with 2 to 3 tablespoons of olive oil and place it in the oven for a few minutes, so the oil gets very hot and rolls easily around the pan.",
    "Drain your potatoes and immediately spread them on oiled baking sheet in one layer. Drizzle with last tablespoon of olive oil, sprinkle with salt and roast for 20 minutes, until golden underneath. Toss potatoes around to encourage them to color evenly and return them to the oven for another 5 minutes. Repeat this 1 or 2 more times (for me, 30 minutes total roasting time is the sweet spot), until your \u201cfries\u201d are deeply golden, brown at the edges and impossible not to eat.",
    "Season with more salt while they\u2019re hot, pile them on a platter and dig in."
