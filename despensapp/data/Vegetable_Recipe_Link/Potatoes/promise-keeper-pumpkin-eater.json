    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Put liners in 12 standard-sized muffin cups.",
    "Stir or whisk together flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and spice in small/medium bowl. ",
    "In a larger bowl, whisk together pumpkin, oil, eggs and 1 1/4 cups sugar. Add dry ingredients to wet and stir until just combined. Divide batter among muffin cups (each about 3/4 full).",
    "Stir together last tablespoon of sugar and teaspoon of cinnamon. Sprinkle over each muffin. ",
    "Bake until puffed and golden brown and wooden pick or skewer inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 25 to 30 minutes.",
    "Cool in pan on a rack five minutes, then transfer muffins from pan to rack and cool to warm or room temperature.",
    "Do ahead: Most muffins don\u2019t keep well, but these are excellent on Day 2 (after being stored in an airtight container at room temperature) and not bad at all on Day 3. If longer, I\u2019d keep them in the freezer until needed."
