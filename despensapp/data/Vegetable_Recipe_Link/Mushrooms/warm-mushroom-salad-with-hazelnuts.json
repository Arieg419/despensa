    "Preheat the oven to 375\u00b0F. Toast the hazelnuts on a baking sheet for 8 to 10 minutes, rolling them around once or twice to make sure they toast evenly. Rub nuts in a dish towel to remove skins then let cool. Chop the hazelnuts coarsely.",
    "Whisk the shallots, vinegar, 1/2 teaspoon salt together in a bowl and let sit for five minutes (this will soften and almost pickle the shallots), before whisking in 5 tablespoons olive oil.",
    "Heat a large saut\u00e9 pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter until the butter foams. Add half the mushrooms, half the thyme and season with salt and pepper. Saut\u00e9 the mushrooms for about 5 minutes, until they\u2019re softened but not limp (your cooking time will depend on the type of mushrooms you used).",
    "Transfer mushrooms to a plate then repeat with the second half. When they are cooked, return the first half of the mushrooms to the pan then toss in sliced shallots, cooking for an additional 2 minutes.",
    "Spread salad greens on a plate. Sprinkle fresh herbs on top, if using. Spoon hot mushrooms over the salad greens. Pour three-quarters of the vinaigrette in the saut\u00e9 pan and swirl it in the pan until heated. Season it with 1/4 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper. Pour over salad and toss carefully. Adjust to taste \u2014 you may need more salt, pepper, vinaigrette or even more sherry vinegar.",
    "Use a vegetable peeler to shave cheese over the salad. Sprinkle with hazelnuts. Serve immediately."
