    "In a blender combine all of the ingredients (excepting the butter for coating the pan) and pulse for 10 seconds. (Too lazy to bust out a blender, I mixed the flour and salt and slowly whisked in a mixture of the eggs, milk, water and butter.) Place the crepe batter in the refrigerator for one hour, or up to 48 hours.",
    "Heat a small non-stick pan. Add butter to coat. Pour a couple tablespoons of batter into the center of the pan and swirl to spread evenly. Cook for 30 seconds and flip. Cook for another 10 seconds and throw the crepe in the garbage; seriously, the first one is always cursed. Sometimes the second too. By the time you get to the third one, go ahead and keep what you made, even if it\u2019s not perfect. Lay the cr\u00eape flat on a large cutting board to the cutting board to cool; continue cooking until all of the batter is gone.",
    "Do ahead: Cr\u00eape batter can be made up to two days in advance, stored in the fridge. Cooked, cooled and well-wrapped, cr\u00eapes can be stored for several days in the fridge or up to two months in the freezer. Frozen cr\u00eapes can be thawed on a rack; gently peel them as you need. Filling can be made a day in advance; reheat slowly, over a low flame. I made my cr\u00eapes in advance, and the filling in the morning; it doesn\u2019t take much time (and even less if you clean and slice your mushrooms the night before)."
