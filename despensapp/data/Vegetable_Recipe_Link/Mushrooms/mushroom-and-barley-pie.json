    "Set aside top square of pastry on parchment. Spread cooled filling evenly over pastry on baking sheet, leaving a 1-inch border. Brush border with some of egg wash, and, using parchment, invert second square on top, lightly pressing to seal border. Brush top with remaining egg wash, then crimp border with a fork and trim with a pizza wheel or sharp knife.",
    "Cut a few small steam vents in top of pie and decoratively score pastry. Slide pie on parchment onto preheated baking sheet in oven and bake until puffed and deep golden brown, about 45 minutes.",
    "Do ahead: The filling can be made and pastry rolled out 1 day ahead and chilled. Or, you can assemble the pie up to three hours ahead of time and chill it uncovered until you\u2019re ready to bake it."
