    "Roast chickpeas: Heat oven to 425 degrees F. Toss chickpeas with one tablespoon olive oil, salt and cumin until they\u2019re all coated. Spread them on a baking sheet or pan and roast them in the oven until they\u2019re browned and crisp. This can take anywhere from 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size and firmness of your chickpeas. Toss them occasionally to make sure they\u2019re toasting evenly. Set aside until needed.",
    "Make dressing: Whisk all ingredients together until smooth, adding more water if needed to thin the dressing slightly. Taste and adjust seasoning; don\u2019t worry if it tastes a little sharp on the lemon, it will marry perfectly with the sweet grated carrots.",
    "Assemble salad: Place grated carrots in large bowl and toss with parsley. Mix in 2/3 of the dressing, adding more if desired. Add more salt and pepper if needed. Sprinkle with a large handful of chickpeas (you\u2019ll have extra and if you\u2019re like us, won\u2019t regret it) and pistachios and dig in.",
    "Do ahead: Salad keeps well in the fridge for two days, however, I\u2019d add the chickpeas and pistachios right before serving, so they don\u2019t get soft."
