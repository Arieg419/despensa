    "Roll out a disk of pizza dough 12 to 14 inches in diameter and place it on the back of a lightly floured sheet pan or pizza peel. Using a pastry brush or your fingers, brush the garlic and oil mixture on the dough, leaving a 1/2-inch border. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top of the oiled dough. Spread the pepper mixture on top of the cheese. Slide the pizza directly onto the pizza brick and bake for 4 to 6 minutes, or until the dough is crispy and thoroughly cooked.
