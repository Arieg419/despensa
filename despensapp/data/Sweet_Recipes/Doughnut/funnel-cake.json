    "\nIn a large bowl, whisk eggs with sugar, milk, water and vanilla. Sprinkle salt and baking powder over the batter, then flour, and whisk it until batter is smooth.\nYou can use a funnel, pitcher, squeeze bottle or plastic bag with the corner snipped off to pour your batter into the oil in a thin stream.Are you going to use a funnel? If so, check to make sure your batter is the right consistency to fall through by holding it over your bowl and ladling a little in. I was using one with a 1/2-inch opening and my batter was a tad thick. If yours is, whisk in extra water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it\u2019s right. You might need 2 or 3.Are you going to use a plastic bag with the corner snipped off? Don\u2019t worry about it then, you can always cut the hole a little bigger if the batter doesn\u2019t fall through easily.\nHeat 1-inch of oil in a heavy skillet that\u2019s the size you want your cakes to be to between 350 and 375 degrees F. With your finger over the opening so it doesn\u2019t fall out, ladle batter into your funnel or a plastic bag. I like to put in only as much batter as I\u2019ll need for each cake (1/2 cup for the 8-inch round size) so I can put the funnel down without having to stop it up somehow between uses.\nLet batter squiggle and scribble all over oil. Fry for 1 to 2 minutes on first side, until golden underneath. Flip with tongs and fry on the second side for about 1 minute, until golden all over. Remove from oil and blot briefly on paper towels. Ensure that the oil temperature is still correct, then fry remaining cakes. Transfer each to a double layer of paper plates and blizzard on the powdered sugar. Eat with your fingers."
