    "I don\u2019t have Dutched cocoa: Dutch-process cocoa (generally speaking, it\u2019s the standard in European brands) differs from natural cocoa (what you have if your cocoa isn\u2019t labeled Dutch, or if it\u2019s an American brand) in that its acidity has been neutralized to form a darker, nuttier cocoa that I prefer. That said, if you don\u2019t have Dutched but only a regular or natural cocoa, I haven\u2019t tested this cake with it but suspect that you\u2019ll be just fine, although the cake may be less dark in color.",
    "How I like to swirl frosting: I always use a small offset spatula (have I convinced you to buy one yet? Seriously, $4. Do it.) and I think the secret is to always push the frosting from the center out, not pull it back. So, push and then make an S-swirl, push and S-swirl, repeat and always quit while you\u2019re ahead (hard, because it\u2019s so fun). ",
