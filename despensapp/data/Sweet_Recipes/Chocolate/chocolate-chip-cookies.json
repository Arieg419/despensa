    "Adjust the oven rack to the top third of the oven and preheat to 300F (150C). Line three baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Beat the sugars and butters together until smooth. Mix in the egg, vanilla, and baking soda.",
    "Stir together the flour and salt, then mix them into the batter. Mix in the chocolate chips and nuts.",
    "Scoop the cookie dough into 2-tablespoon (5cm) balls and place 8 balls, spaced 4 inches (10cm) apart, on each of the baking sheets.",
    "Bake for 18 minutes, or until pale golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.",

    "* Hey, Deb, Didn\u2019t These Cookies Used to Go By Another Name? Why, yes, they did! As was explained in the original post, in his book, David Lebovitz names these cookies after a now-shuttered cookie shop in Ghiradelli Square, who bequeathed the recipe to them. However, the name of that cookie shop is now trademarked by an apparently unrelated cookie company who sent this site a Nastygram for the \u201cunauthorized\u201d use of their brand name which caused confusion among their customers who might wrongly believe that the recipe belonged to them and accusing this site of \u201cintentionally capitalizing on their goodwill of their trademark.\u201d Thus, the title has been updated.",
