    "\t\tWithin reason, I think if you\u2019re craving something, you should go for it, although this theory is mostly born of my own poor logic. I\u2019ve all too many times craved, say, a brownie but thought I shouldn\u2019t eat a brownie and so instead snacked on (just for a completely random example) 12 almonds, 1 slice of cheese, half an apple, 1 banana and then, oops, a handful of chocolate chips, amounting roughly 3x the calories of a brownie, a brownie that I craved exactly as much as I did 500 calories ago. And so, when I really want a brownie, I make my favorite brownies and we each eat one and then I stash the rest in the freezer, so they are not out on the counter, calling to me that we haven\u2019t been cut in a straight line and you should really even us out or we\u2019re going to go bad soon and you don\u2019t want us to go to waste or any of those things that brownies tell me when we\u2019re alone together.",

    "[Hm, here I should probably interject some sort of \u201csure, okay, brownies talk to me but I\u2019m not like crazy or anything; it\u2019s not weird. Brownies talk to everyone, right? Haha?\u201d reassurance but I\u2019m not going to. I\u2019m going to make this as awkward as possible.]",

    "Unfortunately, or maybe predictably, the only thing years of stashing brownies in the freezer has taught us is that frozen brownies are very, very good. They\u2019re chewy but not hard, fudgy and intense and I know this sounds like madness but I\u2019d take a cold brownie over a freshly baked, warm, squishy, steamy one any day. ",

    "Thus, this was inevitable. If brownies are good frozen, they\u2019re even better enlisted as the header and footer of an ice cream cloud. This might actually be both the easiest and winning-est summer dessert. The one-bowl brownies bake in 15 minutes, head directly to the freezer until cold (another 15 minutes), after which they are filled with ice cream (or ice cream combination; I went for Neapolitan because: summer), lidded, and cut into squares. You will be a hero among your people. Most importantly, the ice cream sandwiches are stored in the freezer, away from temptation, and nothing bad ever comes of that.",

    "This uses the recipe for My Favorite Brownies, but I drop the sugar by 1/3 cup for more of a bittersweet contrast with the sweet ice cream; you won\u2019t miss it at all. The batter is divided into two 8\u00d78 pans (although you can use a single 9\u00d713 for a teensy bit thicker brownie that you can later cut in half to form a top and bottom layer) and bakes in half the time. You can tweak the brownie flavor by adding ground cinnamon, mint extract or some espresso powder. I used a little shy of 3 cups ice cream for this (1 1/2 pints, although I took a 1/2 pint from three flavors, chocolate, vanilla and strawberry, to be difficult) though I think they\u2019d be just fine with only 2 cups ice cream filling, and easier to bite into. For extra fanciness, you can swirl in some homemade hot fudge (with or without the mint), butterscotch, or salted caramel sauce, or you can roll the sides of the ice cream sandwiches in colored sprinkles, toasted and chopped nuts or cookie crumbs.
