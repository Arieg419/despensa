    "Whip cream with a spoonful or two of powdered sugar and a dash of a flavoring of your choice, until the whipped cream holds firm peaks. Spread about two teaspoons whipped cream between each cookie, to the edges, and stack them until you reach the height you\u2019d like. If you spread whipped cream on top of the final cookie, you will end up with a softer lid \u2014 a good thing \u2014 but I prefer the look of the brown cookie top.",
    "Set them in the fridge at least overnight or up to a day. The cookies will soften as they set, and become cake-like."
