    "Heat your oven to 350\u00b0F. Generously grease and flour or (coat with a nonstick spray) two loaf pans (8\u00d74 or 9\u00d75; this doesn\u2019t fill the pans so smaller is fine). Alternatively, you can grease 24 standard muffin cups or line them with paper liners.",
    "Whisk eggs, oil or butter, sugar and vanilla in the bottom of a large bowl. Sprinkle cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, baking powder and salt over wet ingredients and whisk them in well. Stir in zucchini. Gently stir in flour, mixing only until flour disappears. Stir in any add-ins, from nuts to chocolate.\nDivide between prepared pans and bake for 55 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. [Muffins will bake far more quickly, approximately 20 to 25 minutes.] You can let them cool for 10 minutes on a rack before inverting and removing cakes from pans, or just let them cool completely in pans. Store it wrapped in foil at room temperature for up to 5 days."
