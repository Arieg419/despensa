    "2. With a 1 1/2-inch round cookie cutter, cut out 8 or 9 circles. Cover all the marzipan you are not using immediately with plastic wrap so it doesn\u2019t dry out.",
    "3. Roll one piece of marzipan into a ball the size of a marble and pinch with your fingers to shape into a cone about 1 to 1 1/4 inches high, tapering to a fine point at the top.",
    "4. Take another round of marzipan and wrap it like a petal around the cone, pinching it at the bottom to adhere and at the top to thin and ruffle slightly like a flower. Repeat with the remaining \u00e2\u20ac\u0153petals,\u00e2\u20ac\u009d overlapping slightly as you work your way around. If necessary, use a little water to help glue the marzipan in place.",
    "Some Prep and Travel Tips",
    "The more cakes I make, the more I get back to the basics I learned when I worked in a bakery in high school. Previously, I never thought that all of those \u201cextra\u201d things they did applied to the home baker; I was wrong.",
    "First, I baked the cake itself a few days in advance, flash-froze them, wrapped each layer in three sheets of plastic wrap, and decorated it, still frozen. This made them very easy to maneuver, and saved me from the chaos that would be baking and decorating in one session. (It also saved us the  mighty inferno of last weekend\u2019s weather. By the time the heatwave hit, I\u2019d already had all the cakes baked, THANK GOD.) Wrapped well, you can freeze cakes for up to a month and nobody would ever know upon tasting the final product.",
    "Second, I finally started using cake boards, or those cardboard rounds about 1-inch wider in diameter than the cake. Bakeries use them for a reason: they protect the sides of the cake when it is boxed up. They also make it very easy to transfer the cake from box to plate. You can line them with a shiny foil paper or a doily. Having tried both, I think I prefer the former.",
    "Third, I\u2019m finally slipping some scraps of waxed paper under the cake, protecting the board from my decorating messes. Yes, I know this is Cake Decorating 101 material, but my laziness always won out in the past.",
    "Finally, I didn\u2019t even bother trying to use my cake carrier. I simply bought three boxes from a local bakery (they give them to us for about $2 each, the smartest money we spend.) Hearkening back to my bakery days, I tied them with bakery string, the honest-to-god easiest way to carry a boxed cake, while keeping it balanced. In a pinch, you can even stack the boxes (rotating each one slightly, so their sides cross the corners of the box below), though I don\u2019t recommend this for any extended period of time."

  "ingredient_list": [
    "For the cake",
    "3/4 cup skinned pistachio nuts",
    "1 2/3 cups sugar",
    "2 cups cake flour",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "8 ounces unsalted butter, at room temperature",
    "1/2 cup milk",
    "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
    "5 eggs, lightly beaten",
    "For the marzipan",
    "8 ounces almond paste",
    "1 1/2 cups confectioners\u2019 sugar",
    "1/4 cup light corn syrup",
    "For the dark ganache glaze",
    "1 pound extra-bittersweet chocolate",
    "1 1/4 cups heavy cream",
    "3/4 cup apricot preserves",
    "Make the cake",
    "1. Preheat the oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C). Butter three 8-inch round cake pans. Line the bottom of each pan with a round of parchment or waxed paper and butter the paper.",
    "Make the marzipan",
    "1. Crumble the almond paste into a large mixing bowl. Use an electric mixer on low speed to soften the almond paste. Add the confectioners\u2019 sugar and corn syrup and beat until smooth. Wrap well in plastic so it doesn\u2019t dry out, and allow to rest at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours before rolling out.",
    "Make the dark ganache glaze",
    "1. Chop the chocolate coarsely and put it in a heatproof bowl. Bring the cream to a bare simmer. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate and let stand for 5 minutes. Whisk until smooth and use the glaze soon after making so that it doesn\u2019t set.",
    "Assemble the cake",
    "1. Roll out a third of the marzipan on a work surface dusted with a little confectioners\u2019 sugar to about 1/8-inch thickness.",
    "Note: To make marzipan roses",
    "1. First, tint the marzipan, if desired, by kneading in a tiny amount of paste food coloring, dabbing just a small bit onto the marzipan with the tip of a toothpick. Flatten the tinted marzipan into a disk and roll out on a work surface dusted with confectioners\u2019 sugar or between 2 sheets of waxed paper to a sheet 1/8 inch thick."
