    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Melt butter in microwave in heatproof bowl until just melted when stirred. Add graham cracker crumbs. Mix and then press evenly into the bottom of 8\u00d78 baking pan. ",
    "Layer coconut, pecans, butterscotch and chocolate chips on top of graham cracker base. Pour sweetened condensed milk over whole mixture. ",
    "Bake in oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is light brown.",
    "Like all brownie and cookie bars, I find them easier to cut cleanly once they\u2019ve been thoroughly cooled in the fridge, but I also don\u2019t expect you to be able to wait that long. ",
    "Because they\u2019re so sweet, I like to cut them into really tiny squares. Those mini-cupcake liners come in handy as well, too, so they don\u2019t all cluster together, not that anyone would mind. "
