I liked that they were tiny as I was pretty sure my one year-old doesn\u2019t need to be eating an adult-sized popsicle this summer. Nor do I need to be washing it out of his clothes. :) The popsicle maker works just fine, but because it\u2019s in one piece, it\u2019s best to unmold them all together (dipping the base in warm water). From there, you can spread them out on a tray in the freezer until they firm up again, then store them in a freezer bag for the long term. I didn\u2019t use the sticks they provide; I remember from my own childhood that they get all chewed up and easily lost when you are sent outside with your drippy sticky treat. I instead bought disposable popsicle sticks, though I\u2019m sure they\u2019re even cheaper from a crafts store."

The raspberries will quickly but you can hasten the peaches along by setting them in a larger bowl of ice water for 10 to 15 minutes. In a blender or food processor, puree peaches and their syrup first, then scrape into a measuring cup with a spout and stir in almond extract, if using, then puree raspberries and place in a smaller spouted cup. (The raspberry color would muddle the peach puree much more than vice-versa, hence blending peaches first.)\nPour a tiny splash of raspberry (you\u2019ll only want to use half of your total sauce) in the bottom of each popsicle mold or small glass that you\u2019re using as a mold (I like champagne flutes, for this and really everything), following by a larger splash of peaches (again, using about half the puree) and dolloping in a little softened ice cream. Repeat with remaining raspberry, peaches and ice cream. Use a skewer to lightly marble the mixtures together \u2014 I get the best swirls by swiping the skewer right along the inside of each mold.
