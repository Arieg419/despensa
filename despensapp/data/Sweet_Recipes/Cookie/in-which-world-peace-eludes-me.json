    "Sift the flour, cocoa and baking soda together. ",
    "Working with a stand mixer, preferably fitted with a paddle attachment, or with a hand mixer in a large bowl, beat the butter on medium speed until soft and creamy. Add both sugars, the salt and vanilla extract and beat for 2 minutes more. ",
    "Turn off the mixer. Pour in the flour mixture, drape a kitchen towel over the stand mixer to protect yourself and your kitchen from flying flour and pulse the mixer at low speed about 5 times, a second or two each time. Take a peek \u2014 if there is still a lot of flour on the surface of the dough, pulse a couple of times more; if not, remove the towel. Continuing at low speed, mix for about 30 seconds more, just until the flour disappears into the dough \u2014 for the best texture, work the dough as little as possible once the flour is added, and don\u2019t be concerned if the dough looks a little crumbly. Toss in the chocolate pieces and mix only to incorporate. ",
    "Turn the dough out onto a work surface, gather it together and divide it in half. Working with one half at a time, shape the dough into logs that are 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs in plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 3 hours. (The dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. If you\u2019ve frozen the dough, you needn\u2019t defrost it before baking \u2014 just slice the logs into cookies and bake the cookies 1 minute longer.) ",
    "Getting ready to bake: Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 325\u00b0F (160\u00b0C). Line two baking sheets with parchment or silicone mats. ",
    "Working with a sharp thin knife, slice the logs into rounds that are 1/2 inch thick. (The rounds are likely to crack as you\u2019re cutting them \u2014 don\u2019t be concerned, just squeeze the bits back onto each cookie.) Arrange the rounds on the baking sheets, leaving about one inch between them. ",
    "Bake the cookies one sheet at a time for 12 minutes \u2014 they won\u2019t look done, nor will they be firm, but that\u2019s just the way they should be. Transfer the baking sheet to a cooling rack and let the cookies rest until they are only just warm, at which point you can serve them or let them reach room temperature. ",
    "Serving: The cookies can be eaten when they are warm or at room temperature \u2014 I prefer them at room temperature, when the textural difference between the crumbly cookie and the chocolate bits is greatest \u2014 and are best suited to cold milk or hot coffee. ",
    "Do ahead: Packed airtight, cookies will keep at room temperature for up to 3 days (Deb note: not a chance); they can be frozen for up to 2 months. They can also be frozen in log form for months, and can be sliced and baked directly from the freezer, adding a coupld minutes to the baking time.",
    "Updated 12/18/11: Upon realizing that there were a few discrepancies in the gram weights, I\u2019ve removed them until I can retest this and replace them with more accurate numbers. Hopefully, this week. Thank you. "
