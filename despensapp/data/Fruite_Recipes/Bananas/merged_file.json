            "Make the crepe batter: Blend banana in a food processor until totally smooth. Add melted butter, blend again. Add remaining ingredients and blend until they are combined. Transfer batter, which will look pretty thin, to a bowl (even easier later if it has a spout), cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour, preferably overnight, and up to two days. When you remove the batter, it will seem surprisingly thick. Stir it to redistribute the ingredients before using it.", 
            "Cook the crepes: Heat a medium skillet or crepe pan over medium-high heat. Once heated, brush pan thinly with melted butter. Pour 1/4 cup batter into skillet, swirling it until it evenly coats the bottom and cook, undisturbed, until the bottom is golden and the top is set, about 2 to 3 minutes. Flip* the crepe and cook it for 30 seconds on the other side, before transferring it to a plate to cool. Repeat with remaining batter. You can stack your crepes and they should not stick together. Let crepes cool completely.", 
            "* Here\u2019s my Weirdo Two-Spatula Crepe Flipping Method: I have two spatulas handy, one flexible fish-style spatula (these are my favorite, for everything, because they\u2019re so thin) and one smaller, like an offset icing spatula. I slide the larger one just a little bit under the crepe and lift it enough that I can slide the smaller one under. I lift it enough that I can get the larger one far underneath the crepe, then use the larger one alone to flip it. It makes it very easy, I promise.", 
            "Make filling: Whip cream cheese until fluffy, then beat in yogurt, 1/2 cup at a time. When fully combined, add sugar and vanilla then beat until rich and fluffy, just another minute.", 
            "Assemble crepe cake: Lay first crepe on a cake plate or serving platter. Spread with 1/4 cup of the yogurt-cream cheese filling. Repeat with all but the last remaining crepe, which should be stacked but have no filling on top, as it is the lid.", 
            "Make walnut butterscotch sauce: Combine the cream, brown sugar and butter in the bottom of a medium, heavy saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally in the beginning and more frequently as it reduces and thickens. You\u2019ll know it\u2019s done when it becomes thick and smells toasty. Stir in the vanilla and salt, then walnuts. Immediately pour over stack of filled crepes, nudging the butterscotch to the edges with your spoon \u2014 if it goes over the edge, so be it.", 
            "Serve immediately, or keep in fridge until ready to serve. Crepe cake keeps for up to 3 days, possibly longer, but good luck with that."

            "Whirl all of the frosting ingredients except the melted chocolate in a food processor until smooth. Set aside about 3/4 cup of the white frosting for the lighter areas, eyes, nose and mouth, then add the chocolate to finish making the fudge frosting, and whirl it until light and smooth. You\u2019ll use this frosting to fill and coat the majority of the monkey cake.", 
            "To the lighter frosting, you can add a small spoonful of the chocolate frosting and a drop or two of yellow food coloring for tinting, and set this aside in a small bowl. This will be the color you use for your monkey\u2019s \u201cface\u201d.", 
            "Tip: If your kitchen is as hot and sticky as mine is in the summer, you\u2019ll want to watch a frosting like this carefully to make sure it doesn\u2019t get too melty and soft. If it does, periodically put the bowl of frosting and your partially frosting cake back in the fridge to let it firm up and cool down again, then resume where you left off.", 
            "Assembling Your Monkey Cake(s)", 
            "Option 1: A 2-layer 9-inch monkey cake with a 4 to 5-inch \u201csmash\u201d cake. This is what I did, but it had ended up yielding (and thus, wasting) more cake than necessary. My original plan had been to cut the third layer into ears for the large cake, and a two-layer, 4.5-inch diameter \u201csmash\u201d cake. And then I realized that a 2-layer, nearly 4-inch tall smash cake was going to be ridiculous, and made it only one layer instead. Have twins? This is totally the way to go, as you can make two 1-layer (or divide them into two layers, to mimic the big cake) smash cakes. One baby? You\u2019ll waste less cake if you go with one of the options below.", 
            "How to: Firm up one of your cake layers in the freezer; this will make carving shapes from it much easier. Once firm, cut one or two 4 1/2-inch diameter round monkey \u201cheads\u201d from it, being sure to leave little bumps on either side for the ears. Cut two additional small circles from the cake scraps that remain, and cut them each in half, creating two half-moon shapes. These will become the ears of your larger cake. Place one of your large, untouched cake rounds on your serving platter. Slip little scraps of waxed paper underneath, all around. This will keep your platter clean as you decorate the cake. Pin a half-circle \u201cear\u201d to each side of the cake with a toothpick. If your cake has domed a bit while baking, level it with a long serrated knife. Thickly top this layer with chocolate frosting. Put the second layer on top, and attach its ears with two additional toothpicks. Level it again, if needed (though a domed top layer is less of a decorating concern). With your lighter colored frosting, outline the shape of your monkey face on top. (A piping bag with a large, round tip or a zip-loc baggie with the corner snipped off makes this much easier.) Fill the shape in generously with the light frosting. With your dark chocolate frosting, coat the remainder of the cake and sides in a thin layer. This is your crumb coat, and it will keep those crumbs from getting into your final frosting. Once finished, pop your cake in the fridge so that the frosting firms up a bit. Once it has, generously frost the dark chocolate areas with a second coat of fudge frosting. Don\u2019t worry about getting it perfectly smooth \u2014 everyone loves an imperfect homemade cake. Touch up the lighter area if needed with additional frosting. Put a small bit of fudge frosting in either a piping bag with a small round tip or a plastic bag with the corner cut off and use it to make the eyes, nose and mouth on the monkey. When you\u2019re finished, remove the waxed paper scraps. Repeat this process on a smaller scale, minus the pinned-on ears, on your small monkey shape.", 
            "Option 2: A 2-layer 9-inch monkey cake with 1 cupcake \u201csmash\u201d cake. Make the amount of batter for a two-layer cake, and pour off 3 cupcake\u2019s worth of batter into buttered and floured cupcake molds.", 
            "How to:  Cut two of your cupcakes half, to form four half-moon shapes. These will become the ears of your larger cake. Place one of your large cake rounds on your serving platter. Slip little scraps of waxed paper underneath, all around. This will keep your platter clean as you decorate the cake. Pin a half-circle \u201cear\u201d to each side of the cake with a toothpick.

When you\u2019re finished, remove the waxed paper scraps. Pipe or ice your last cupcake with a similar monkey face \u2014 this will be your \u201csmash\u201d cake for the baby. ", 
            "Option 3: A 2-layer 9-inch monkey cake and no \u201csmash\u201d cake. Don\u2019t need or want a smash cake? Don\u2019t feel like pinning ears to a larger cake and worrying about forgetting to take the toothpicks out? Just make 2 9-inch layers, and modify the monkey shape ever so slightly to include ears in one piece.", 
            "How to:  Firm up your cake layers in the freezer; this will make carving shapes from it much easier. Carefully trim each layer into a round monkey head with two half-circle ears coming out at 9 and 3 o\u2019clock. Place the first one on your serving platter. Slip little scraps of waxed paper underneath, all around. This will keep your platter clean as you decorate the cake. If your cake has domed a bit while baking, level it with a long serrated knife.

            "What, no downloadable PDF stencils for the cake? Yeah, it was a bummer for me as well to realize that I\u2019m not Martha Stewart this weekend, and don\u2019t have the graphic designers on staff to make this kind of stuff for me. Nor, does it turn out, do I have a single drawing program on my computer. Thus, if you\u2019re itching for a visual, we\u2019re just going to have to kick it old school with my low-fi doodles, m\u2019kay?",
