    "Place the egg yolk in a stainless steel bowl. Begin whisking in the grapeseed oli drop by drop, as slowly as you can bear. (I find having a second person dripping it in makes it easier.) Continue in this manner until the mixture begins to thicken.Once the mayo has emulsified, you can add the rest of the oil in a slow, steady stream (however, as a beginner, I still take it very slowly), whisking all the time. Arm getting tired? Try to murmur \u201cjiggle-free upper arms\u2026 sleeveless sundresses\u2026\u201d to yourself. I find it helps.",
    "Combine the shallot, 1 tablespoon lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Whisk in the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and buttermilk. Gently whisk this mixture into the mayonnaise, and taste for balance and seasoning.",
    "Slice the apples and pears away from the core. Cut into 1/8-inch thick slices (I went even thinner, using a mandoline) and place them in a large salad bowl. Tear the radicchio into bite-sized pieces and add to the salad bowl. Toss salad with half of dressing (Goin suggests three-fourths but I found this to make an overly-creamy salad; you can always add more) and season with salt and pepper. Add a squeeze of lemon juice and a little more dressing if necessary.",
    "Transfer to a platter (chilled, if you\u2019re being fancy) and scatter the mint and parsley on top."

    "1 extra-large egg yolk (I used one large and a smidgen of another)",
