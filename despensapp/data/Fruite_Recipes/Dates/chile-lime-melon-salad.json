    "Place melon in a wide bowl or on a platter. Squeeze half lime juice over, adding second half to taste, then sprinkle with salt and chili powder. Scatter with cheese, pepitas and cilantro and dig in.",
    "Do ahead: I\u2019d expected this salad not to keep at all but we found it just fine (with no watery run-off) after 2 hours in the fridge. I wouldn\u2019t keep it assembled too much longer, though. You don\u2019t want the salt to draw the juices out of the fruit before you eat it, and it\u2019s quick enough to put together at the last minute.\n"
