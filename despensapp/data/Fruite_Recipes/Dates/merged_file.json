            "If you\u2019d like the smoothest date shake: Pour boiling water over dates in a medium bowl, cover with a lid and let steep for 10 to 15 minutes (longer if you have time). Blend both water and dates in blender until smooth \u2014 it will seem like too much water at first but will eventually become a thickish puree. Transfer to freezer for a few minutes to cool it, if it\u2019s not cold enough already. Add date puree back to blender bowl, if they\u2019re not there already.", 
            "If you don\u2019t mind some nubby bits of dates in your shake: Blend dates with a splash or two of the milk until they\u2019re finely ground.", 
            "Both methods: Add nutmeg, milk and ice cream and blend until smooth. Pour into glasses, top with whipped cream and a cherry. ",

            "Use all the ingredients above, plus 1/4 cup smooth peanut butter, 1/4 cup chocolate syrup and 2 medium bananas and blend until smooth. You\u2019ll end up with 5 small (8-ounce) shakes instead of 4, but that last one can be your little secret."

            "Rinse and dry the grapes, and pull them carefully from their stems. Using a small sharp knife, trim away the \u201cbelly button\u201d at the stem end of the grape (and try not to eat all of the belly buttons at once, m\u2019kay?), exposing a bit of the flesh inside. Divide the grapes among 2 pint-sized clean, dry canning jars.", 
            "In a medium saucepan, combine the remaining ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium heat and then you have two choices. The original recipe has you pour the bring mixture over the grapes and let them cool together. I personally prefer a cold brine on certain foods, not wanting to wilt the fresh fruit, so I cool the brine completely before pouring it over. The former will yield a more tender pickle, and it will pick up the brine\u2019s flavor faster. The latter will take a bit longer to souse, but the grapes will stay more firm. Both will be delicious.", 
            "Once cool, chill the grape and brine mixture in their jars in the refrigerator for at least eight hours or overnight. Serve cold, perhaps at a cheese course, and I say you should let people figure out for themselves what they\u2019re eating."
