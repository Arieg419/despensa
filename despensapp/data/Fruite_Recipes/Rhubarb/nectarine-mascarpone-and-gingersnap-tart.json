    "For crust: Preheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Finely grind gingersnaps in processor. Add butter and blend until crumbs are evenly moistened. Press mixture over bottom and up sides of 9-inch-diameter tart pan with removable bottom. (I like to use a cold metal measuring cup to get a nice, clear demarcation between the base and sides.) Bake crust until color darkens, pressing sides with back of spoon if beginning to slide, about 8 minutes. Cool completely.",
    "For filling: Beat first 6 ingredients in medium bowl until smooth. Beat in crystallized ginger if you\u2019re using it. Spread filling in prepared crust. Cover loosely and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.",
    "For topping: Overlap nectarine slices atop filling in concentric circles. Brush with jam. Sprinkle with chopped crystallized ginger if you\u2019re using it. (Mint makes an excellent garnish, if you\u2019re skipping the ginger.) Serve, or refrigerate up to 6 hours."
