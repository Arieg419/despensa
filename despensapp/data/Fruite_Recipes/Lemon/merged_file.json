Blend the berries and sugar until fully pureed, and then a minute longer. Press through a fine-mesh strainer if you, like me, prefer your lemonade without seeds. You should have a generous 1/4 cup of each puree.",

If you don\u2019t mind a dark red/purple color and want a stronger black- or raspberry flavor, you can use all of the puree. Extra puree makes an ideal yogurt or yogurt popsicle stir-in, or can be used for additional batches of pink lemonade, because this will go on repeat.",
