Drain potatoes, wipe out pot, and put cream, garlic, lemon zest, salt and pepper back in. Bring to a simmer and cook for one minute, stirring because this will be a tiny amount in a bigger pot. Add drained potatoes and cook together for 1 to 2 minutes more. ",
      "Chop drained and patted dry artichokes into bite-sized (about 1/2-inch) chunks and place in a large bowl. Season with salt and lemon juice to taste. Add potato-cream mixture and 3/4 cup grated cheese and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning and adjust salt and pepper if needed (will probably be needed). Add up to 2 extra tablespoons heavy cream if the mixture seems a little dry. ",
      "Heat the broiler on your oven, or simply your oven itself to 450\u00b0F. Arrange slices of bread on a foil-lined tray (for easy clean up) and heap artichoke-potato mixture evenly over slices. Sprinkle with reserved cheese, and bake or broil until browned and melty, anywhere from 5 minutes under a good broiler to 10 to 15 minutes in a less-intense oven. Eat hot and repeat again tomorrow."

From here, you have a few decoration options: you can place the apricot halves in facedown or up all over the pistachio base. You can do as I did, which is cut them into strips, then slide each cut half onto a butter knife or offset spatula, tilt it so that it fans a little, and slide it onto your pistachio filling decoratively.
